//! Reusable shared-storage buffers, keyed by length.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! A launch that allocates its own scratch pays Metal for the
//! allocation every time it runs. That is invisible in the
//! `FERROX_METAL_GPU_TIMING` ledger, which times `commit` to
//! completion, so it reads as neither GPU time nor submission latency:
//! it is host time inside the launch.
//!
//! It was measured on the fused recurrent branch
//! (`crate::gdn_branch`). That launch is correct and removes about 17
//! ms of host recurrence from a Bonsai decode token, and its first
//! version ran 7.22 to 6.68 tok/s -- SLOWER -- against a ledger that
//! accounted for only 10 ms of the 19 ms it had lost. The missing part
//! was eleven fresh buffers per layer per token, some 500 allocations a
//! token. Making the layer's constants resident and wrapping the
//! convolution window in place recovered 6.68 to 6.98; this recovers
//! the rest.
//!
//! # What makes it sound
//!
//! Buffers are handed out and returned by the SAME call, which waits
//! for its command buffer before returning them, so a buffer is never
//! in two command buffers at once and the GPU is never reading one that
//! has been handed to somebody else. A caller that returned them before
//! waiting would be the bug this design cannot express: [`Scratch`]
//! owns them and gives them back on drop.
