//! The one lookup path every address-keyed resident-buffer cache takes,
//! and the proof each entry has to give before it may be served.
//!
//! # What went wrong (GitHub issue #180)
//!
//! Two caches in `gpu.rs` mapped `(host pointer, host length)` to an
//! `MTLBuffer` built from those bytes. A host address is not an
//! identity: free the allocation and the next one of the same size gets
//! the address back, and the cache then serves the new tensor the old
//! tensor's uploaded bytes.
//!
//! `resident_weight_buffer` knew that and defended itself twice -- a
//! mmap keepalive on the zero-copy path, a sampled fingerprint on the
//! copy path. `resident_f32_buffer`, sitting seventy lines below it in
//! the same file with the same key type, defended itself not at all.
//! That is this repo's dominant bug shape: two structures that must
//! agree about one thing with nothing enforcing it.
//!
//! What it cost: `POST /admin/models/load` swaps checkpoints in one
//! process, and a `Decoder`'s RMSNorm gammas are owned `Vec<f32>`s that
//! are freed with it. Loading Llama-3.2-1B-Q4_K_M and then
//! Llama-3.2-1B-Q6_K put the second model's gammas at the first
//! model's freed addresses -- 49 stale hits in a 24-token decode,
//! measured -- and the answer came back fluent and wrong. The Studio
//! model selector is that endpoint.
//!
//! # The rule now
//!
//! An entry may be served only if it can still prove it holds the
//! caller's bytes ([`Resident::still_holds`]), and [`get_or_build`] is
//! the only way to read one of these caches. A new cache added here
//! inherits the check by construction: it cannot be looked up without
//! an entry type that answers the question, and answering it `true`
//! unconditionally is a thing a reviewer can see, unlike an absent
//! check nobody wrote.
