//! ferrox-metal: Apple Silicon GPU capability detection (always
//! compiled, always tested) plus an optional, feature-gated Metal
//! compute execution path.
//!
//! Build without any GPU support (the default): `cargo build -p ferrox-metal`.
//! Build with the Metal scaffolding included (macOS only):
//! `cargo build -p ferrox-metal --features metal`.
//!
//! Unlike `ferrox-cuda`'s CUDA path (which had to be verified against
//! rented hardware since this development machine has no NVIDIA GPU),
//! the `metal` feature's kernels have been run directly on the real
//! Apple Silicon GPU this project is developed on -- see `gpu.rs`'s
//! module docs for exactly what's been verified and against what.
