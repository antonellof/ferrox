//! `ferrox batched-bench` -- a `llama-batched-bench` work-alike.
//!
//! Throughput as a function of batch size: for every combination of
//! prompt length (`-npp`), generation length (`-ntg`) and parallel
//! sequences (`-npl`), one row reporting prompt speed, decode speed
//! and the total, in the same ten columns `llama-batched-bench`
//! prints so the two tables can be read side by side. The workload is
//! `tools/batched-bench/batched-bench.cpp:132-235` and the row format
//! is `:245`; `workload.rs` and `report.rs` cite the lines they mirror.
//!
//! # What it drives
//!
//! Not HTTP (`ferrox serve-bench` does that) and not a third decode
//! path. Prefill goes through `Decoder::forward_batch_last_host_kv`,
//! one sequence at a time, which is what the continuous batcher does
//! for a row it admits; decode goes through `Decoder::forward_multi_seq`,
//! which is the batcher's per-tick step (`ferrox-server/src/serving/
//! batch/worker.rs:470`). So the numbers are the engine seams the
//! server runs on, measured without the server around them.
//!
//! # What it reuses from `ferrox bench`
//!
//! The measurement contract (`bench_contract`): quiet, cool, not-full
//! host before the clock; host state on both sides of the run; a
//! receipt refused at write time when its label disagrees with the
//! backend that ran. And the guards (`bench_guard`): token streams
//! asserted before the run, cold caches asserted per repetition, the
//! prompt and decode lengths re-read from the KV afterwards, and the
//! determinism pair -- identical input (workload digest) and identical
//! output (greedy pick) between the discarded warmup and the timed
//! run. Every row runs twice for exactly that reason: a single timed
//! pass has nothing to be compared against.
//!
//! # Flags that refuse
//!
//! `-b` (`n_batch`), `-kvu`, `-fa` and `-tb` are accepted by the
//! parser and refused by name, because ferrox has nothing behind them
//! and a flag that is accepted and ignored has burned this repo before.
//! [`refuse_unhonoured_flags`] is an exhaustive destructure, so a new
//! flag cannot be added without deciding which side it is on.
