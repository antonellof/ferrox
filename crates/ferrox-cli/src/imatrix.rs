//! `ferrox imatrix`: llama.cpp's `llama-imatrix`. Runs a calibration
//! text through a model and writes, per quantizable weight, the
//! per-column sum of squared activations that `ferrox quantize
//! --imatrix` and `llama-quantize --imatrix` weight the fit by.
//!
//! The method is `tools/imatrix/imatrix.cpp` at b7650, and each piece
//! is cited where it is implemented:
//!
//! * **What is collected** (`imatrix.cpp:229-237`): the f32 input of
//!   every matrix multiplication whose weight is under `blk.`, and
//!   `output.weight` with `--process-output`. Norm weights and the
//!   embedding lookup are not matrix multiplications; on a tied model
//!   the output head is `token_embd.weight` and is not collected
//!   either. Expert weights are collected per expert, with one count
//!   each (`:302-317`).
//! * **The accumulation** (`:365-372`): `values[j] += x[j]*x[j]` per
//!   row, `counts += rows`. In [`collector`].
//! * **The chunking** (`:909-1013`): tokenize the whole file once with
//!   the checkpoint's BOS rule, split into non-overlapping chunks of
//!   `--ctx-size`, and overwrite each chunk's first token with BOS
//!   when the vocabulary adds one. At least two chunks' worth of
//!   tokens is required (`:934`). Each chunk is one forward pass over
//!   a fresh KV cache (`llama_memory_clear`, `:983`).
//! * **The file** (`:507-615` GGUF, `:401-505` legacy): in [`file`].
//!
//! Deviations, all stated rather than hidden. `llama-imatrix` folds
//! `n_batch / n_ctx` chunks into one batch as separate sequences;
//! ferrox runs one chunk per forward pass. The rows reach the
//! accumulator in the same token order either way, so the sums are
//! the same arithmetic. `llama-imatrix` prints a perplexity as it goes
//! (`--no-ppl` turns it off); ferrox does not, because `ferrox
//! perplexity` already computes that number by llama.cpp's method and
//! a second copy here would be a second copy. Special-token markers in
//! the text are always parsed, which is `llama-imatrix
//! --parse-special`, because ferrox's tokenizers have no mode that
//! does not (and on the repo's own docs that is a ten-token
//! difference over 60 KB, which shifts every chunk). There is no
//! `--in-file` combining of earlier matrices.
//!
//! # Why it runs on the CPU
//!
//! Activations are observed through `ferrox_core::activation_tap`, a
//! seam at the two functions every projection goes through. The tap
//! sees what the CPU path is handed; the GPU paths hand their inputs
//! straight to a command buffer. So the backend is pinned to CPU
//! through the same `apply_env` `ferrox bench --n-gpu-layers 0` uses,
//! which reads the decision back rather than trusting the flag.
//!
//! # What ferrox's file shares with llama.cpp's, and what it does not
//!
//! The format, the entry names, the counts and the accumulation rule
//! are the same, so either tool's file feeds either quantizer, and a
//! `llama-imatrix` file through `ferrox quantize --imatrix` gives
//! `llama-quantize --imatrix`'s bytes. The sums are not bit-identical,
//! because the activations are not. Measured on Qwen3-0.6B over 8
//! chunks of prose on which both tokenizers agree exactly: the layer-0
//! pre-attention entries agree to 7e-6 (relative, per column), the
//! first attention block puts 3e-3 between the engines, and it
//! compounds to 2.7e-2 per column by layer 27 (L2-relative over
//! entries: median 7.4e-4, max 6.0e-3). That gap is unchanged by
//! llama.cpp's KV cache type and by BF16 versus F32 weights, so it is
//! the two engines' attention arithmetic, which is `ferrox parity`'s
//! subject, not this tool's. `--compare` prints the gap per entry so
//! the bound is a number rather than a claim, and `docs/CLI.md` has
//! the table.
