//! The envelope every timed engine run shares: what is checked before
//! the clock starts, what is reported after it stops, and what a
//! receipt must carry to be worth reading later.
//!
//! `ferrox bench` and `ferrox batched-bench` measure different
//! workloads through different engine seams, but the measurement
//! contract around them is ONE thing: a quiet, cool host with the
//! weights in RAM; the load and thermal state recorded on both sides
//! of the run; a receipt whose backend label is the backend that ran
//! and whose GPU row names its card. Each of those rules exists
//! because it was broken once and published (#126 is the label one).
//! Having them here, as functions both tools call, is what keeps the
//! second tool from drifting away from the first the way copied code
//! does in this repo.
