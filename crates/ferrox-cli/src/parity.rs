//! Answer parity against llama.cpp, measured on the distribution rather
//! than on sampled text.
//!
//! Why this exists: `ferrox verify` compares ferrox-CPU against
//! ferrox-Metal, so it can prove the two ferrox backends agree with each
//! other while both disagree with the reference implementation. The
//! quality gate in `docs/plans/llama-cpp-parity-push.md` says a row is
//! only closed when "answers match llama", and nothing measured that.
//!
//! Why not greedy text: it was tried. With tokenization matched by hand
//! (6 tokens on both sides) ferrox and llama.cpp still diverged after
//! about three tokens on TinyLlama Q8_0, a model with no exotic graph
//! features. Greedy text is a chain of argmaxes, so ordinary
//! last-bit numeric drift flips one token and every token after it is
//! then conditioned on different input. A text diff cannot separate "the
//! graph is wrong" from "two near-tied logits swapped", and those are
//! the only two hypotheses worth telling apart.
//!
//! So this compares the FIRST-TOKEN distribution at the last prompt
//! position: one forward pass per engine, no sampling, no feedback. The
//! same token ids are fed to both sides, which removes the tokenizer
//! from the experiment — ferrox tokenizes, and llama.cpp is handed the
//! resulting ids.
//!
//! Removing the tokenizer from THIS experiment is right, and for years
//! it also meant nothing tested the tokenizer at all: a single hardcoded
//! pre-tokenizer regex mistokenized every digit run of four or more and
//! every whitespace run of two or more, on Llama-3.x, Qwen, DeepSeek and
//! SmolLM, and the repo's only cross-engine oracle was structurally
//! unable to see it. So `parity` now runs a SECOND comparison first, in
//! [`tokenize`]: same file, same library, ferrox's token ids against
//! llama.cpp's for a corpus built out of the inputs the pre-tokenizers
//! actually disagree on. It runs before the logit comparison because a
//! tokenizer divergence means the distribution comparison below is
//! measuring two different prompts.
//!
//! The reference side is a small C program (`tools/llama_logits.c`)
//! linked against the installed `libllama`, in the same spirit as the
//! IQ-tier goldens, which link ggml's own `ggml-quants.c` rather than
//! re-reading the format spec. A reference you re-implemented is not a
//! reference. Build it with `tools/build_llama_logits.sh`.
//!
//! `--dumper` may be given MORE THAN ONCE, each pointing at a dumper
//! built against a different libllama. That is not a convenience: it is
//! what turns the WRONG verdict from a fitted constant into a
//! measurement this run makes for itself. See [`calibration`].
