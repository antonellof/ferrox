//! The sampler knobs an OpenAI request body carries, resolved to
//! [`SamplingParams`] in exactly one place.
//!
//! `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/completions` cannot share a request
//! struct -- their bodies are genuinely different shapes -- so each
//! names its own wire fields. What they must NOT each own is the
//! mapping: which knobs exist, and what each one means when the caller
//! said nothing. That copy had already drifted. `/v1/completions`
//! hardcoded `top_k: 0` and `repetition_penalty: 1.0` while the chat
//! route read both off the request, so four real sampler fields were
//! dropped by serde on one route and honoured on the other -- the same
//! defect as `logit_bias`, four more times.
//!
//! So the knobs are one struct and the defaults are one function. A knob
//! added here is added to both routes at once, or to neither.
