//! What a saved slot is *of*, and how a restore refuses a slot that is
//! of something else.
//!
//! A slot file holds raw attention state: per-layer K and V floats
//! computed by one set of weights at one quantisation for one token
//! sequence. Restoring those numbers under a different checkpoint does
//! not fail, and does not look like a failure -- the shapes can match,
//! the decode runs, and the answer is confidently wrong. So identity is
//! not a nicety here; it is the difference between a cache and a
//! corruption.
//!
//! # Why the identity is not the path, the size, or the config
//!
//! This repo has been bitten twice in one week by a cache keyed on
//! something that could not tell two things apart: a Metal buffer cache
//! keyed on host address and length, and a resident activation matched
//! on length alone. The candidates that look sufficient and are not:
//!
//! - **The file path.** Two servers, two machines, one path; or the same
//!   path re-quantised in place.
//! - **The file size.** Two fine-tunes of one base at one quantisation
//!   are byte-for-byte the same length.
//! - **The decoder config.** Same reason. Two fine-tunes of Llama-3.2-1B
//!   at Q4_K_M agree on every hyper-parameter there is.
//!
//! Every one of those admits a pair of genuinely different checkpoints,
//! and the pair it admits is the *likely* pair -- fine-tunes of one base
//! are exactly what an operator has several of.
//!
//! # What is actually hashed
//!
//! [`fingerprint_gguf`] takes SHA-256 over a canonical
//! encoding of:
//!
//! 1. the GGUF version, and every metadata key/value in sorted key
//!    order -- architecture, all hyper-parameters, and the entire
//!    tokenizer, typed, so `U32(4)` and `String("4")` cannot collide;
//! 2. the full tensor directory: every tensor's name, shape, dtype tag
//!    and data offset, which is what changes between two quantisations
//!    of one model;
//! 3. up to [`SAMPLE_BYTES`] from the head **and** the tail of every
//!    tensor's data.
//!
//! Step 3 is the one that separates two fine-tunes, and it is why this
//! reads weights at all: steps 1 and 2 are identical for them. Head and
//! tail rather than head alone because a checkpoint edited only in its
//! last rows -- a re-trained output head, a patched embedding -- is a
//! real shape, and a head-only sample would call it the same file.
//!
//! It is a sample, not the whole file, and that is a deliberate trade
//! stated here rather than buried: hashing 70 GB on every slot operation
//! would make the operation unusable, and two checkpoints that agree on
//! every metadata value, every tensor's name/shape/dtype/offset, and the
//! first and last 4 KiB of every single tensor are not a pair that
//! exists. What the sample cannot do is detect deliberate collision, and
//! it is not asked to: a slot file is not a trust boundary, it is an
//! operator's own cache.
//!
//! # Three checks, in order
//!
//! Mirroring [`ferrox_core::kv_signature`], whose rule this module
//! follows rather than reinvents: a stored slot is (1) rejected if it
//! carries no identity at all -- absence is never agreement; (2) checked
//! against its own payload, so a header may not vouch for a width the
//! floats do not have; and only then (3) compared to what this server
//! is serving. Step 2 is the easy one to skip: without it, "the header
//! says 8 KV heads" and "there are 8 KV heads" are two claims a reader
//! would be treating as one.
