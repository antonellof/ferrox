//! The served checkpoint's own chat template, evaluated.
//!
//! # What this replaced
//!
//! This module used to *sniff* `tokenizer.chat_template` for literal
//! markers -- `<|im_start|>`, `<|start_header_id|>`, `<start_of_turn>`
//! -- and pick one of six hand-written renderers. That was a disclosed
//! scope decision when there was no Jinja evaluator in the workspace.
//! There is one now (`ferrox_models::chat_template`, which compiles the
//! checkpoint's real template with minijinja), and it had no caller, so
//! the server was still serving Mistral-Instruct `user: hi` because
//! `[INST] … [/INST]` matches none of those markers. The sniffer's three
//! silent failure modes are written up in that module's doc comment; all
//! three are gone here by construction, because the template is now
//! evaluated rather than recognised.
//!
//! # What this adds on top of it
//!
//! Three things the evaluator deliberately leaves to its caller:
//!
//! 1. **Message shape.** [`PromptTemplate::render`] converts the
//!    server's `ChatMessage` into the OpenAI-shaped JSON a real template
//!    reads (`message.role`, `message.content`, `message.tool_calls`,
//!    `message.tool_call_id`, and a replayed chain of thought under all
//!    three spellings families use for it).
//! 2. **Who describes the tools.** A template that really consumes
//!    `tools` -- established by rendering with and without one, not by
//!    looking for the word -- gets them as structured JSON and owns the
//!    whole tool grammar. A template that does not gets the text
//!    preamble this server has always used (`tool_preamble` in
//!    `lib.rs`), and replayed calls are folded back into `content` as
//!    the same `<tool_call>{…}</tool_call>` marker text the preamble
//!    asks for -- so a conversation looks consistent to the model on
//!    every turn regardless of which half of that split it lands in.
//! 3. **The effort vocabulary.** Probed once at load
//!    ([`crate::policy::effort::probe_effort_profile`]) rather than per request,
//!    because it costs ~30 renders and never changes for a checkpoint.
//! 4. **The end-of-turn marker.** Derived by rendering a conversation
//!    whose assistant turn is closed and diffing it against one that is
//!    not ([`crate::policy::turn::probe_end_of_turn`]). Gemma IT ends a
//!    turn with `<end_of_turn>` and Yi-1.5 with `<|im_end|>`, neither of
//!    which is that checkpoint's EOS, so both need the string in their
//!    stop set or the model talks past the end of its own answer.
//!
//! All four probes run once, at load, which is what lets them be renders
//! rather than guesses.
//!
//! # Nothing here matches template source any more
//!
//! The last substring check was the end-of-turn marker, which had an arm
//! per family -- `<start_of_turn>`, `<|im_end|>`, `<|turn>` -- and so
//! reported nothing for a family nobody had yet written an arm for. It
//! is now derived from the render like the other three, which is both
//! the same mechanism and the same reason: what a template PRINTS is the
//! question, and its source is a proxy that answers a different one.
