//! **WHICH TENSOR THE MoE ROUTER READS** -- the operand of
//! `ffn_gate_inp`, as one value a `ModelConfig` carries and one table
//! that says which architecture reads what.
//!
//! # What it is
//!
//! llama.cpp's `build_moe_ffn` (`llama-graph.cpp:1914-1948`) computes
//! the router logits itself, `logits = gate_inp · cur`, from the SAME
//! `cur` the experts then read -- the normed FFN input -- UNLESS the
//! caller hands it a precomputed `probs_in`, in which case `gate_inp`
//! is unused and the caller decided the operand. Every ferrox MoE body
//! computed `router · normed2`, which is the default and right for
//! every graph that takes it.
//!
//! # Who passes `probs_in` -- MEASURED, not read off one file
//!
//! Every `build_moe_ffn(` call in all 140 `src/models/*.cpp` was parsed
//! for its `gate_inp` and `probs_in` arguments (2026-09-11). Fifty-nine
//! call sites; four pass a precomputed `probs_in`:
//!
//! | arch | router operand | why precomputed | engine here | line |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | `smallthinker` | `inpL` -- the RAW LAYER INPUT, before `attn_norm`, before attention | the operand is different | generic GQA | `smallthinker.cpp:111,151-161` |
//! | `grovemoe` | `cur` -- the normed FFN input, the default | shared between TWO `build_moe_ffn` calls (the expert bank and the chunk-expert bank) | generic GQA, refused for the second bank | `grovemoe.cpp:133,137-148,153-164` |
//! | `gemma4` | `rms_norm(attn_out) * (1/sqrt(n_embd)) * ffn_gate_inp_s` -- the attention output, its own norm, a scale tensor | the operand is different | its own engine (`gemma4_engine`) | `gemma4.cpp:289-294` |
//! | `nemotron-h` | `cur` -- the FFN input BEFORE the latent down-projection the experts read | the experts read `inp_latent`, the router does not | hybrid recurrent engine | `nemotron-h.cpp:210-232` |
//!
//! Two more route on something other than a variable named `cur` and
//! are the default anyway: `llama4.cpp:221` passes `ffn_inp_normed`
//! (the normed FFN input) and `cohere2moe.cpp:234,389` pass `ffn_inp`
//! (the parallel-residual topology's one normed input, which its
//! experts read too). Fifty-three sites pass `nullptr` or the 13-arg
//! overload and route on `cur`.
//!
//! So `smallthinker` is the ONLY generic-path graph whose router
//! operand is not what the experts read, and [`RouterInput`] had two
//! variants rather than four: `gemma4`'s and `nemotron-h`'s shapes
//! live on engines that do not read this field, and a variant with no
//! caller is the OLMo lesson (`capability::WEIGHTED_LAYER_NORM`).
//! `grovemoe` shares the mechanism (a precomputed `probs`) and NOT the
//! cause; that is why the table is keyed by what the router reads and
//! not by whether `probs_in` is non-null.
//!
//! # The third variant: a different `cur` -- `arctic`
//!
//! `arctic.cpp:135-152` passes NO `probs_in`; its router reads `cur`,
//! the default mechanism. What differs is `cur` itself:
//! `build_norm(inpSA, ffn_norm_exps)` at `:136-139` -- the residual
//! stream as it ENTERS the layer (`inpSA = inpL`, `:69`), before
//! attention, normed by a SECOND per-layer weight -- and the routed
//! experts read that same vector, while the layer's dense FFN
//! (`:118-132`, `crate::parallel_dense_ffn`) reads the ordinary
//! `ffn_norm(ffn_inp)`. `grep -l FFN_NORM_EXPS src/models/*.cpp` over
//! all 140 graphs is `arctic.cpp` (2026-09-12), so
//! [`RouterInput::NormedLayerInput`] has one row and carries the fact
//! that distinguishes it from `smallthinker`'s: the EXPERTS read it
//! too ([`RouterInput::experts_read_router_operand`]). The bodies
//! capture it at the same point as `smallthinker`'s logits -- where
//! `attn_norm` is applied, before attention -- through
//! `Decoder::router_operand`, and every fused Metal MoE launch refuses
//! it through the predicate that already refused `RawLayerInput`.
//!
//! # What `inpL` is, exactly
//!
//! `smallthinker.cpp:86` sets `inpL = build_inp_embd(...)` and `:172`
//! sets `inpL = cur` at the bottom of every layer, so at layer `il` it
//! is the residual stream as it ENTERS the layer: the scaled embedding
//! row at layer 0, the previous layer's output after both residual
//! adds otherwise. `:111` reads it BEFORE `:115` norms it for
//! attention, so the router sees no norm at all. ferrox captures it at
//! the same point (`Decoder::router_operand`, called where the row's
//! `attn_norm` is applied) and computes the logits there, in the same
//! order llama.cpp does, so the operand cannot be the post-attention
//! residual by mistake.
//!
//! Everything downstream of the logits is the ordinary
//! `build_moe_ffn` (`:151-161`): `expert_gating_func` from the file
//! (`conversion/smallthinker.py:27-30` writes SOFTMAX or SIGMOID),
//! `norm_w = true` as a literal, `expert_weights_scale` unset
//! (skipped at 0), no `exp_probs_b`, no shared expert, no groups.
//! `Decoder::route_for_layer` already implements all of that.
//!
//! # Where it is served, and where it refuses
//!
//! The CPU row body and both batched host bodies take the operand
//! from `Decoder::router_operand`, ONE function, and hand it to the
//! ONE FFN body per shape (`decoder/ffn_block.rs`). Every Metal path
//! that runs the router on the GPU reads `normed2` and nothing else,
//! so `Decoder::gpu_router_matches_host_routing` -- the predicate all
//! of them already share -- answers false for [`RouterInput::
//! RawLayerInput`], and those launches fall back to the host bodies
//! rather than routing on the wrong tensor.
