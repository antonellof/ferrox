//! `LLAMA_SWA_TYPE_CHUNKED`: a "window" that is the query's own chunk.
//!
//! llama.cpp's third window kind (`llama-hparams.h`, `is_masked_swa`):
//! under `STANDARD` a query at `p` sees keys `p - n_swa < k <= p`;
//! under `CHUNKED` it sees `k / n_swa == p / n_swa`, the keys in its
//! own chunk of `n_swa` positions and nothing before. So a chunked
//! layer's visible span RESETS at every chunk boundary, where a sliding
//! one slides.
//!
//! One graph of 155 sets it (`grep -l SWA_TYPE_CHUNKED src/models/
//! *.cpp` is `llama4.cpp:13`), from LITERALS: `n_swa = 8192`, a
//! 3-chunked-1-full period of 4, and the attention temperature's three
//! constants, on the branch a file takes unless it declares
//! `attention.sliding_window` PRESENT AND ZERO (`:5-11`). The file's
//! nonzero value is never read. The zero branch is what the converter
//! writes for a model whose every layer is full attention
//! (`conversion/llama.py:391-394`), and libllama ABORTS on it
//! (`llama-graph.cpp:159`, `GGML_ASSERT(f_attn_temp_scale != 0.0f)`:
//! the branch leaves the temperature scale at zero and the graph still
//! builds the temperature input; measured on
//! `scripts/make_llama4_fixture.py --noswa`), so ferrox refuses it by
//! name rather than answer where its reference cannot.
//!
//! # How it is served
//!
//! Chunked attention for a query at `p` is a sliding window of
//! `p % n_swa + 1` positions -- per query. The single-query kernels
//! take exactly that ([`ModelConfig::layer_window_for_query`]), and the
//! batched prefill body takes its per-query arm for a chunked layer
//! (the blocked kernel takes one window for the batch). `KvCache`
//! eviction keeps the last `n_swa` rows, a superset of any chunk, so a
//! chunked layer evicts like a sliding one and never under-retains.
//! The fused Metal launches take one sliding window per layer and
//! refuse the model (`Decoder::metal_can_serve_model`).
//!
