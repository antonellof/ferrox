//! **Which layers rotate.** llama.cpp's per-layer `use_rope` gate, as
//! one rule with a table, rather than one branch per architecture.
//!
//! Every architecture ferrox had audited rotates Q and K on every
//! layer, and that is llama.cpp's default too. Eight architectures
//! upstream do not, and until 2026-09-10 ferrox had no way to say so:
//! three of them were REFUSED for it, one ran WRONG, and two were
//! latent behind other refusals. The first census counted SIX, because
//! it grepped for the word `use_rope`; `cohere2.cpp:91` and
//! `cohere2moe.cpp:192` spell the same gate as `if (is_swa)` around
//! `ggml_rope_ext` and were found on 2026-09-14 by grepping for that
//! (`olmo2` and `mellum` also test `is_swa` there, but rotate BOTH
//! branches -- the sliding one with the scaling off, `crate::
//! swa_geometry` -- so they are not gates).
//!
//! # The eight, transcribed
//!
//! | arch | llama.cpp | line |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `exaone4` | `is_swa(il) \|\| swa_type == NONE` | `exaone4.cpp:116` |
//! | `exaone-moe` | `is_swa(il)` | `exaone-moe.cpp:136,155` |
//! | `cohere2` | `is_swa(il)` | `cohere2.cpp:72,91` |
//! | `cohere2moe` | `is_swa(il) \|\| il < n_layer_dense_lead` | `cohere2moe.cpp:177-179,192` |
//! | `smollm3` | `(il + 1) % 4 != 0` | `smollm3.cpp:5,69` |
//! | `smallthinker` | `step == n_layer \|\| il % step != 0` | `smallthinker.cpp:18,108-109` |
//! | `afmoe` | `step > 0 && (il + 1) % step != 0` | `afmoe.cpp:137-138` |
//! | `llama4` | `step > 0 && (il + 1) % step != 0` | `llama4.cpp:11,145-146` |
//!
//! **`exaone-moe` and `exaone4` are ONE rule, not two that look
//! alike.** `exaone-moe.cpp:4` sets `swa_type = LLAMA_SWA_TYPE_STANDARD`
//! unconditionally, so its `is_swa(il)` is exactly `exaone4`'s
//! `is_swa(il) || swa_type == NONE` with the second disjunct nailed to
//! false. Read side by side the two `if` bodies are the same two
//! `ggml_rope_ext` calls guarded by the same predicate; the only
//! difference is that `exaone4.cpp:4` reaches that predicate solely when
//! `n_layer() == 64`.
//!
//! `smallthinker` collapses onto the same shape ONLY BY COINCIDENCE and
//! is deliberately NOT written that way here. With a window it takes
//! `set_swa_pattern(4, dense_first = true)`, so `is_swa(il)` is
//! `il % 4 != 0`, which happens to equal its `use_rope`; llama.cpp's own
//! comment at `smallthinker.cpp:107` says "this overlaps with SWA layers
//! in current models". They are two independent constants -- the SWA
//! period comes from `{arch}.attention.sliding_window_pattern` and the
//! no-RoPE step never does -- so a file overriding the period to 2 would
//! separate them, and collapsing the two would rope such a file wrong in
//! precisely the way this module exists to stop.
//!
//! # Why a step is never a GGUF key
//!
//! `hparams.n_no_rope_layer_step` is set from a literal in every one of
//! the four architectures that use it and read from no key anywhere in
//! llama.cpp (`grep -rn n_no_rope_layer_step src/`). `llama-hparams.h:203`
//! defaults it to **4**, which is why `afmoe` and `llama4` are in the
//! table despite never assigning it: they inherit the default and their
//! graphs consult it. So there is nothing for a metadata gate to test.
//! A checkpoint of any of these six loads clean, carries the generic
//! tensor set, runs at full speed and answers from positions it never
//! encodes that way.
