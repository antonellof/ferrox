//! The DRY repetition sampler ("Don't Repeat Yourself"), ported from
//! llama.cpp's `llama_sampler_dry` (`src/llama-sampler.cpp:3078-3400`),
//! which is itself a port of Koboldcpp PR 982 by pi6am.
//!
//! # What it does that the repetition penalty cannot
//!
//! `penalties` looks at SINGLE tokens: a token that occurred in the
//! window is made less likely, once. DRY looks at SEQUENCES. It asks,
//! for every token the model could emit next, "how long a repetition of
//! earlier context would emitting this token continue?", and penalises
//! by `multiplier * base ^ (that length - allowed_length)`. A model
//! looping on a four-token phrase is not emitting one over-represented
//! token, so the repetition penalty barely moves it while DRY's
//! exponential grows every time round the loop.
//!
//! # The three parts, and where each one comes from
//!
//! * [`DryBreakers`] is `get_overlapping_token_sequences`
//!   (`src/llama-sampler.cpp:3095`): the sequence breakers a caller
//!   gives as STRINGS, tokenised against the loaded vocabulary. A
//!   breaker is a point the repetition detector refuses to look past,
//!   so `"\n"` stops one paragraph's phrasing from penalising the next.
//!   It has to be done against the model's own vocabulary because a
//!   breaker string is usually not a whole token: `":"` may only ever
//!   appear as the tail of `"foo:"`, so the entry is keyed on the token
//!   that CONTAINS it and carries whatever tokens must follow.
//! * [`DryParams::penalties`] is `llama_sampler_dry_apply`
//!   (`src/llama-sampler.cpp:3151`), including the reverse Z-algorithm
//!   that finds, in one linear pass, how long a suffix ending at each
//!   position also occurs elsewhere in the window.
//! * [`crate::sampler_chain::Candidates::dry`] subtracts the result.
//!
//! # Why the parameters are a struct with private fields
//!
//! Because enabling DRY without tokenising its breakers is a silent
//! wrong answer, not an error: the sampler runs, penalises across
//! newlines it was told to stop at, and nothing says so. So there is no
//! way to build an ENABLED [`DryParams`] without handing it a
//! [`DryBreakers`], and the only way to build a non-empty
//! [`DryBreakers`] is [`DryBreakers::from_vocab`], which needs a
//! vocabulary. A caller that genuinely wants none writes
//! [`DryBreakers::none`] and that is visible in the diff.
