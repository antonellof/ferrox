//! A second, smaller GGUF used as the drafter for speculative decoding.
//!
//! [`crate::speculative`] already had the half that is hard to get
//! right: the rejection rule, which makes speculation lossless at every
//! temperature rather than only at `--temp 0`. What it did not have was
//! a drafter worth running. The only implementation in the tree is
//! [`crate::speculative::PromptLookupSpeculator`], an n-gram match over
//! the history with no model at all. It is free, and it helps on
//! repetitive text, and it cannot carry a coding workload.
//!
//! # Why this is the item that moves the ceiling
//!
//! Decode reads every weight in the model to emit one token, so
//!
//! ```text
//! tokens/sec <= memory bandwidth / model bytes
//! ```
//!
//! is arithmetic, not engineering. A 17 GB checkpoint on a 960 GB/s
//! card cannot pass about 56 tok/s however good the kernels are. Better
//! kernels move an engine toward that number; they cannot move it past.
//!
//! A draft model changes what is read per token instead of how fast it
//! is read. A 2 GB drafter proposes `k` tokens, the target checks all
//! `k` in ONE pass over its 17 GB, good guesses are kept and bad ones
//! discarded, and the text is exactly what the target would have
//! written alone.
//!
//! # The two things this has to get right
//!
//! **The draft KV must roll back.** While proposing, the drafter
//! advances its own cache over tokens the target has not accepted and
//! may never accept. If those rows are left in place, the drafter's
//! context silently diverges from the target's. Nothing errors: the
//! accept rate just decays, which reads as "this drafter is bad" rather
//! than "this drafter is desynchronised". [`DraftModelSpeculator`]
//! therefore truncates to `synced` at the top of every `propose`, and
//! `synced` only ever counts tokens the caller's history actually
//! contains.
//!
//! This is the repo's dominant bug shape in its usual dress: two
//! structures that must agree about one thing, here the target's
//! history and the drafter's cache, with nothing enforcing it. What
//! enforces it is that `synced` is derived from the history passed in
//! on every call rather than remembered independently, so the drafter
//! cannot hold an opinion about the history that the history disagrees
//! with.
//!
//! **The vocabularies must match.** See [`VocabMismatch`].
