//! **A DENSE FFN SUMMED WITH THE ROUTED EXPERTS** -- the Grok-2 and
//! Arctic layer shape, served through the shared-expert slot, with the
//! two things that differ between the two graphs as one table.
//!
//! # What it is
//!
//! `src/models/grok.cpp:66-68` creates `ffn_gate` / `ffn_up` /
//! `ffn_down` as `TENSOR_NOT_REQUIRED` beside the routed experts, and
//! `:171-184` does this when they are present:
//!
//! ```text
//! if (model.layers[il].ffn_up) {
//!     ffn_out = build_ffn(cur, ffn_up, ffn_gate, ffn_down, LLM_FFN_GELU, LLM_FFN_PAR, il);
//!     cur = ggml_scale(ctx0, ggml_add(ctx0, ffn_out, moe_out), std::sqrt(2) / 2);
//! } else {
//!     cur = moe_out;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `src/models/arctic.cpp:38-42` creates the same three REQUIRED, sized
//! `{n_embd, n_embd}`, and `:118-154` runs `ffn_out = build_ffn(
//! ffn_norm(ffn_inp), ...SILU, PAR)`, `moe_out = build_moe_ffn(
//! ffn_norm_exps(inpSA), ...)` and sums them with no scale.
//!
//! # Reach -- MEASURED
//!
//! Over all 140 `src/models/*.cpp` (2026-09-12): every graph that calls
//! `build_moe_ffn` AND reads a dense `layers[il].ffn_up` was listed;
//! all but two use the dense triple on their LEADING dense layers
//! (`if (il < n_layer_dense_lead)` or `if (ffn_gate_inp == nullptr)`)
//! or as `_shexp`. The two that SUM a dense FFN with the routed output
//! on one layer are `grok.cpp:171-184` and `arctic.cpp:118-154`. So
//! [`PARALLEL_DENSE_FFN_ARCHITECTURES`] has two rows, and the two free
//! parameters are the columns: whether the triple is required
//! (`arctic`) or optional (`grok`: Grok-1 has none and takes the
//! `else`), and the scale on the sum (`sqrt(2)/2` for `grok`, none for
//! `arctic`). What does NOT differ and so is not a column: the dense
//! branch reads the normed FFN input `cur` in both, and its activation
//! is the architecture's dense activation (GELU for `grok`, SiLU for
//! `arctic`), which is what `ModelConfig::layer_ffn_acts(il).dense`
//! already answers for the shared-expert slot. Arctic's OTHER
//! difference -- the routed branch reading `ffn_norm_exps(inpSA)` --
//! is `crate::router_input::RouterInput::NormedLayerInput`, one graph
//! of 140, and not this module's business.
//!
//! # Why the shared-expert slot
//!
//! `MoeWeights::shared_experts` is already "a dense FFN that fires on
//! every token and is added to the routed sum", computed with the
//! architecture's dense activation on the normed FFN input, in the
//! row body and the batched body alike; every fused Metal MoE launch
//! refuses a layer that has one. What the slot lacked was the tensor
//! NAMES (it loads `_shexp`) and the scale on the sum, which is why
//! this module used to be a refusal: reading Grok-2's triple into it
//! would have dropped the `sqrt(2)/2`. The loader fills the slot from
//! the dense names for these two architectures and records the row's
//! scale on the layer (`MoeWeights::parallel_sum_scale`), which the
//! FFN bodies apply to the WHOLE branch output -- `ffn_out + moe_out`
//! -- before the post-FFN norm, where `grok.cpp:180` applies it. A
//! Grok-1 layer has no triple, loads no shared expert and carries no
//! scale, which is the `else` branch.
