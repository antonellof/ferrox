//! The [`Engine`] seam, and the one place every engine behind it enters
//! the CPU worker pool.
//!
//! # Why this trait lives in its own file
//!
//! `decoder/entry.rs` holds the same rule for [`crate::decoder::Decoder`]:
//! **a forward pass enters the pool once, at its outermost boundary.**
//! #167 applied it to the generic decoder's ten entry points and stopped
//! there, so every dedicated engine -- Gemma-4, Kimi K3, GLM-5.2,
//! DeepSeek-V4 Pro, the MLA stack -- still paid the cold arm once per
//! parallel region.
//!
//! Those five engines have exactly one thing in common, and it is this
//! trait. So the wrapper is written ONCE, as [`Engine::forward_token`]'s
//! provided body, and an engine supplies only
//! [`Engine::forward_token_on_worker`]. There is no per-engine copy of
//! the wrapper to drift, and an engine added later is promoted without
//! its author having to know the rule exists.
//!
//! # What the wrapper buys
//!
//! `rayon::join` and the `par_iter` bridges cost very different things
//! depending on who calls them. From a rayon worker the caller runs one
//! half itself and waits on a spin latch; from any other thread the job
//! is injected and the caller blocks on a pthread condvar, contributing
//! no arithmetic while it sleeps. A decode step opens roughly five
//! parallel regions per layer, so a 30-layer model was paying ~150 of
//! the second kind per token, and the driving thread was measured
//! holding 74% of the token inside `__psynch_cvwait`.
//!
//! [`ferrox_core::par::on_workers`] turns those ~150 cold entries into
//! one, and [`ferrox_core::par::cold_regions`] is how a test says so
//! without a stopwatch. Nesting is free -- a call from inside another
//! `on_workers` returns directly -- so an engine whose body already
//! promotes ([`crate::decoder::Decoder`]) costs one extra branch and
//! nothing else.
//!
//! # The invariant this file exists to hold
//!
//! Nothing outside this file may declare `fn forward_token(`, because an
//! `impl Engine for _` that overrode the provided body would bypass the
//! wrapper for that engine alone while every other one still read as
//! fixed. `no_engine_may_override_the_promoted_forward_token` walks the
//! crate's sources and says so.
