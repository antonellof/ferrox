//! Dry-run residency planning: what a checkpoint would cost to run,
//! computed from its GGUF header alone -- no weights loaded, no
//! allocation. This is the "plan before you allocate" half of the
//! residency workstream; the enforcement half at decode time is the
//! bounded expert store (`ferrox_core::expert_store`) plus the global
//! device plan (`ferrox_moe::ResidencyPlan`).
//!
//! Accounting model (deliberately explicit about what it does NOT yet
//! cover): dense/always-resident weight bytes, routed-expert bytes
//! (resident, or capped by the streaming budget), per-request KV-cache
//! bytes at a stated context length, request concurrency, and a safety
//! headroom fraction. Not yet accounted: activation/scratch buffers,
//! tokenizer/runtime overhead, GPU placement (VRAM budgets are planned
//! separately by `ResidencyPlan`), and Kimi's recurrent state (this
//! report reads GGUF headers; the Kimi safetensors path has no
//! header-only reporter yet).
//!
//! The KV line and the fits/does-not-fit verdict are the same
//! arithmetic [`crate::kv_budget`] runs -- this module is the
//! whole-checkpoint view of it (it is the one that knows what the
//! weights cost), and [`ResidencyReport::kv_budget`] hands back the
//! priced inequality so `--ctx auto` and the server's admission check
//! cannot drift away from what `inspect-plan` prints.
