//! **Per-position attention temperature** -- llama.cpp's
//! `llm_graph_input_attn_temp`, as one value a `ModelConfig` carries
//! and one table that says which architectures compute it.
//!
//! # What it is
//!
//! `llama-graph.cpp:155-172` fills an `F32 [n_tokens]` input with one
//! scalar per token,
//!
//! ```text
//! attn_scale[i] = log(floor((pos[i] + offset) / floor_scale) + 1) * temp_scale + 1
//! ```
//!
//! and the graphs that use it multiply Q by that vector -- broadcast
//! over every head and every channel of a token's Q -- AFTER RoPE and
//! BEFORE `build_attn`, with `kq_scale` untouched
//! (`mistral3.cpp:153-156`). The scale is 1 at every position below
//! `floor_scale`, so the effect is invisible on a short prompt and
//! grows stepwise with the position: it is Llama-4's "attention
//! temperature tuning" (`llama4.cpp:15-17` seeds the three constants
//! and calls the input by that name), which mistral3 and deepseek2
//! adopted through a GGUF key.
//!
//! # Who reads it -- MEASURED, not read off one file
//!
//! `grep -ln 'attn_temp\|temperature_scale\|build_inp_attn_scale'
//! src/models/*.cpp` over all 140 graphs, 2026-09-11:
//!
//! | arch | scale | floor | offset | layers | line |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | `mistral3` | `attention.temperature_scale` | `n_ctx_orig_yarn` | 0 | all | `mistral3.cpp:5,14-17,109-111,153-156` |
//! | `deepseek2` (+ `mistral4`, `models.h:1311` reuses its hparams) | `attention.temperature_scale` | `attention.temperature_length` | 0 | all | `deepseek2.cpp:46-49,457-460,595-598,632-635` |
//! | `llama4` | literal `0.1` | literal `8192` | literal `1.0` | the NON-ROPE layers only, and only on its chunked-SWA branch | `llama4.cpp:15-17,122-123,175-176` |
//!
//! Two other hits are NOT this feature and are recorded so nobody
//! re-derives it: `grok.cpp:23` reads `attention.temperature_length`
//! into `hparams.attn_temp_length` and applies it nowhere
//! (`crate::scalar_multipliers` already says so), and `dflash.cpp:133`
//! / `deepseek4.cpp:124` name a `blk.N.hc_attn_scale` TENSOR, which is
//! a hyper-connection weight. `plamo3.cpp:140` is a local variable.
//!
//! So `mistral3` is the ONLY generic-path reader, and this module's
//! resolution is written for the two that read a key. `llama4` seeds
//! literals and gates the multiply on `!use_rope`
//! (`llama4.cpp:175` is an `else if` on the RoPE branch), which is a
//! per-layer variant [`AttnTemperature`] does not have -- deliberately:
//! `llama4` is `DedicatedOnly` for its chunked attention and its own
//! engine, and a variant with no caller is the OLMo lesson. Its
//! verdict says the temperature is one seam away from here.
//!
//! # The floor is `n_ctx_orig_yarn`, which is NOT a key
//!
//! `mistral3.cpp:15` takes the floor from `hparams.n_ctx_orig_yarn`,
//! and `llama-model.cpp:1164-1165` seeds that from `n_ctx_train`
//! (`{arch}.context_length`, REQUIRED) before letting
//! `rope.scaling.original_context_length` override it. So a Ministral
//! file without the YaRN key floors on its context length, not on
//! nothing, and [`resolve_attn_temperature`] takes the already-resolved
//! value rather than the key. `mistral3.cpp:16-17` then throws on a
//! zero floor; ferrox refuses the same file.
//!
//! # Why a nonzero key on any other architecture is IGNORED here
//!
//! `build_qkv` and `build_attn` never look at `f_attn_temp_scale`; only
//! the three graphs above build the input. A `llama` file carrying
//! `llama.attention.temperature_scale = 0.5` runs unscaled in llama.cpp
//! and must run unscaled here, and
//! `a_nonzero_key_on_an_architecture_whose_graph_never_reads_it_is_dead_metadata`
//! pins that. The defect this module closes is the other direction:
//! before it, a `mistral3` file carrying the key loaded and ran at the
//! wrong temperature with no error.
//!
//! # Where it is applied
//!
//! ONE helper, `Decoder::apply_attn_temperature`, called from the CPU
//! row body and both batched host bodies at the point
//! `attention_scale` is applied (after RoPE and the post-RoPE QK-norm,
//! before attention). No fused Metal launch has a per-token Q scale
//! uniform, so `Decoder::metal_can_serve_model` keeps a model with one
//! on the host bodies -- the same fence `clamp_kqv` and
//! `residual_scale` share, for the same reason.
//!
//! The MLA engine (`deepseek2` / `mistral4`) REFUSES a file that
//! declares a nonzero scale rather than implementing it: that engine
//! has no libllama-golden fixture at all, so an implementation there
//! would be a guess with nothing to check it against.
