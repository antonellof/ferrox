//! The output head's two invariants, held as types rather than as
//! coincidences between call sites.
//!
//! 1. [`Logits`]: a vocabulary of logits is softcapped exactly once, by
//!    the only constructor that can produce one. Gemma-2 caps at 30.0,
//!    so a path that projects and returns raw is not an error, just a
//!    quietly different distribution.
//!
//! 2. [`FoldedLmHead`]: `final_norm` + `lm_head` may be folded into a
//!    fused Metal decode stack ONLY when the stack's result is a greedy
//!    argmax token id. That result bypasses `Decoder::logits_from_normed`
//!    entirely, so `final_logit_softcap` never runs on it, and the ONLY
//!    reason that is sound is that `sc * tanh(x / sc)` is strictly
//!    increasing: capping cannot reorder logits, so it cannot move an
//!    argmax. On a full vocabulary of logits it changes every value.
//!
//! Before this module, invariant 2 held by accident. `decoder.rs`
//! computed `out_launch = if greedy_gpu { launch } else { None }` and
//! then passed `greedy_gpu && out_launch.is_some()` as the *separate*
//! `argmax_only` argument -- two hand-written expressions of one fact,
//! either of which could be edited without the other, and
//! `launch_decode_dense_stack(output: Some(..), argmax_only: false)` is
//! a representable call that downloads full uncapped logits which
//! `forward_token` then returned as-is. Nothing stated the coupling and
//! no test could see it break. Here the launch and the `argmax_only`
//! flag are one value with one constructor, and the result is
//! interpreted by [`FoldedLmHead::interpret`], which softcaps anything
//! vocabulary-shaped on the way out.
