//! The ways a sliding-window layer can differ from a full-attention
//! layer in llama.cpp beyond its mask and its RoPE base: a second ROTARY
//! WIDTH, which ferrox now honours; a second HEAD WIDTH, which it
//! refuses by name; and YaRN switched off, which it refuses by name.
//!
//! 1. **A second rotary width.** The base loader seeds `n_rot_swa` from
//!    `n_rot_full` and lets `rope.dimension_count_swa` override it
//!    (`llama-model.cpp:1222-1223`), and `llama_hparams::n_rot(il)` is
//!    `is_swa(il) ? n_rot_swa : n_rot_full` (`llama-hparams.cpp:85-91`).
//!    It is a TWO-VALUED field, not an array -- measured over all 140
//!    graphs when the per-layer shape seam was built. Two things set the
//!    sliding width apart from the full one:
//!
//!    * the key, written by `conversion/laguna.py:115` for Laguna-XS.2
//!      (full layers 64 of 128 dims, sliding layers all 128,
//!      `laguna.cpp:43-45`) and by `conversion/gemma.py:673-674,700`
//!      for Gemma-4, which is on its own engine;
//!    * `step35.cpp:9`, `n_rot_full = n_rot_full / 2`, run AFTER the
//!      base loader seeded `n_rot_swa`, so the sliding layers keep the
//!      file's width and the full ones rotate half of it, with NO key
//!      saying so (the converter only asserts the checkpoint's
//!      `partial_rotary_factors` are 1.0 / 0.5, `step3.py:170`).
//!
//!    [`rotary_widths`] resolves both into `ModelConfig::rope_dim` (the
//!    full layers') and `ModelConfig::rope_dim_swa` (the sliding
//!    layers'), and `ModelConfig::layer_rope` hands each layer its own.
//!    The fused Metal launches take one width for every layer and are
//!    fenced off such a model (`Decoder::metal_can_serve_model`).
//!
//! 2. **A second head width.** `attention.key_length_swa` and
//!    `attention.value_length_swa` (`llama-model.cpp:1216-1219`) give
//!    the sliding layers their own K and V widths. ferrox carries ONE
//!    `head_dim` in every cache geometry and attention kernel, so a
//!    file whose sliding layers differ is refused naming the key
//!    ([`swa_geometry_refusal`]). Gemma-4 writes these; it is on its own
//!    engine.
//!
//! 3. **YaRN switched off on the sliding layers.** Three graphs on the
//!    generic path rope their sliding layers with `freq_scale = 1`,
//!    `ext_factor = 0`, `attn_factor = 1` while their full layers use
//!    the model's scaling: `olmo2.cpp:120-134` (Olmo-3), `mellum.cpp:
//!    128-142`, `laguna.cpp:48,181-193`. Measured by grepping every
//!    `ggml_rope_ext` call under `src/models/` for a zeroed
//!    `ext_factor`; `deepseek4.cpp` is the fourth and is on its own
//!    engine. ferrox folds the frequency half of YaRN into
//!    [`crate::config::RopeFreqs`], which already keeps the sliding
//!    layers unscaled for these three (`swa_rope_scale_follows_model`
//!    is false for all of them), but `rope_attn_factor` -- YaRN's
//!    `mscale` -- is one value for the whole model, so a file with a
//!    window AND a scaling is refused. A window with no scaling, or a
//!    scaling with no window, reduces both branches to the same RoPE
//!    and is served. [`swa_layers_unscaled_rope`] is the table; it used
//!    to be `arch == "olmo2"` in the loader, one row of three.
//!
//! 4. **No rope factors on the sliding layers.** `step35.cpp:247` is
//!    `rope_factors = is_swa ? nullptr : model.get_rope_factors(...)`:
//!    a `rope_freqs.weight` (Step-3.5-Flash's llama3 scaling) reaches
//!    the full layers only, and the sliding layers divide by nothing.
//!    Measured: `grep -l "is_swa ? nullptr" src/models/*.cpp` is
//!    `step35.cpp` and `gemma4-assistant.cpp` (its own engine).
//!    [`swa_layers_drop_rope_factors`] is the table, and the loader
//!    sizes `RopeFreqs::full` to the full layers' width and
//!    `RopeFreqs::swa` to all ones at the sliding layers' width for it.
//!    Any OTHER architecture with two rotary widths and per-band
//!    divisors is refused by name ([`two_widths_with_factors_refusal`]),
//!    because one divisor vector cannot serve two widths and nothing
//!    upstream says which layers would take which.
