//! The ORDER the sampler chain runs in, as llama.cpp's `--samplers`
//! spells it, and the refusal for every sampler ferrox does not have.
//!
//! # Why the order is a parameter and not a constant
//!
//! llama.cpp lets a caller reorder its chain (`--samplers`,
//! `--sampler-seq`, and the server's `samplers` request field). ferrox
//! ran one fixed order, so a command that worked upstream either could
//! not be expressed here or -- worse -- was accepted with the field
//! dropped and answered under a different chain.
//!
//! The order is not cosmetic. `sampler_chain` models the SHRINKING
//! candidate list llama.cpp passes down the chain, and each filter
//! renormalises over the survivors, so moving one step changes which
//! candidates exist for the next. ferrox has already shipped the bug:
//! temperature used to run FIRST, and top-p then summed probabilities
//! temperature had already reshaped, keeping a different candidate set
//! for identical flags.
//!
//! # The one table
//!
//! A list of names in the CLI and a second list in the server is this
//! repo's dominant defect shape: two structures that must agree with
//! nothing enforcing it. So there is exactly one list, in the
//! `sampler_names!` invocation below, and the enum, the canonical
//! spellings, the alias table and the parser are all generated from it.
//! Adding a name is one row.
//!
//! [`SamplerName::implemented`] is the second half of the guarantee: an
//! EXHAUSTIVE `match`, no `..`, that must say for every name whether
//! ferrox runs it or why it does not. A name added to the table without
//! a verdict does not compile.
//!
//! # Partial support, stated
//!
//! ferrox implements llama.cpp's whole default chain: `penalties`,
//! `dry`, `top_n_sigma`, `top_k`, `typ_p`, `top_p`, `min_p`, `xtc` and
//! `temperature`. `mirostat` and `infill` are named in the table purely
//! so that asking for one is a refusal that says WHICH sampler is
//! missing, rather than an unknown-name error or, far worse, a chain
//! quietly built without it. A caller who asked for `mirostat` and was
//! served a chain without it got a different sampler than they
//! requested and no way to tell.
