//! **THE PER-HEAD LAYERNORM ON Q AND K** -- `attn_q_norm` of shape
//! `{n_embd_head_k, n_head}`, a DISTINCT weight per head, applied as
//! `LLM_NORM` (mean-subtracting LayerNorm, no bias) over each head, and
//! which of llama.cpp's graphs build it.
//!
//! # What it is
//!
//! `build_norm(Qcur, attn_q_norm, NULL, LLM_NORM, il)` over a `Qcur` of
//! `{n_embd_head, n_head, n_tokens}` normalises each head's
//! `n_embd_head` values -- mean subtracted, divided by the standard
//! deviation -- and multiplies by that head's OWN row of the weight.
//! Ferrox's QK norm (`capability::QkNormStyle`) is an RMSNorm in every
//! variant, and its per-head form shares ONE `head_dim`-long weight
//! across the heads; a `{head_dim, n_head}` weight is `n_head *
//! head_dim` long, which the loader's length rule would read as
//! `WholeVector` -- one RMS over the whole projection -- and the fused
//! Metal attention infers the same thing from the same length. Two
//! wrongs that agree with each other, which is why this is a refusal by
//! name and not a length case.
//!
//! # Reach -- MEASURED
//!
//! Over all 140 `src/models/*.cpp` (2026-09-12): `grep -A3
//! "build_norm(Qcur" | grep "LLM_NORM,"` is five graphs. Two of them
//! (`bert.cpp:124`, `mpt.cpp:110`) norm the WHOLE projection with a
//! `{n_embd}` weight and a bias, a different op on non-generic rows.
//! The three that create the weight `{n_embd_head_k, n_head}` and norm
//! per head are [`PER_HEAD_LAYER_NORM_QK`]: `stablelm.cpp:34-35,84-97`
//! (OPTIONAL; StableLM-2-12B), `command-r.cpp:28-31,80,87` (REQUIRED
//! at `n_layer >= 64`, i.e. Command-R+), `chameleon.cpp:33-35,91-102`
//! (REQUIRED, with an optional bias). Applied BEFORE RoPE in all three.
//!
//! # What this module does today
//!
//! Refuses the `stablelm` shape by name, from a fixture llama.cpp runs
//! (`tests/fixtures/stablelm_qknorm_tiny.gguf`; libllama's logits differ
//! from the plain file's by 8.73, measured). `command-r` and
//! `chameleon` are refused or deferred before any tensor is read, so
//! their rows are recorded facts for the seam that serves the op: a
//! fourth `QkNormStyle` carrying the per-head weight table, a LayerNorm
//! body in `decoder/qk_norm.rs`, and `metal_attn_view` refusing it
//! until the kernel has a mean-subtracting branch.

/// The three graphs, with the lines, and whether the tensor is
