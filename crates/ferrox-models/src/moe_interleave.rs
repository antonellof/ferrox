//! `{arch}.interleave_moe_layer_step`, and why ferrox serves only the
//! value real checkpoints carry.
//!
//! llama.cpp's `LLM_KV_INTERLEAVE_MOE_LAYER_STEP`
//! (`llama-arch.cpp:223`) says how often a MoE layer appears past the
//! leading dense prefix. `src/models/ernie4-5-moe.cpp:64` is the graph's
//! rule:
//!
//! ```text
//! bool is_moe_layer =
//!     static_cast<uint32_t>(il) >= hparams.n_layer_dense_lead && (il + 1) % hparams.n_moe_layer_step == 0;
//! ```
//!
//! ferrox's `ModelConfig::layer_is_dense` implements only the first
//! half, the leading-dense prefix. This module is the gate that stops a
//! file where the second half would change the answer.
//!
//! # The finding: llama.cpp cannot load such a file either
//!
//! Implementing the modulo was the plan. Building the fixture is what
//! stopped it, because llama.cpp's own tensor loader and its own graph
//! disagree about which layers are MoE, and only the graph has the
//! modulo:
//!
//! * `src/models/ernie4-5.cpp:49` -- the loader --
//!   `if (arch == LLM_ARCH_ERNIE4_5_MOE && (uint32_t) i >= hparams.n_layer_dense_lead)`
//!   creates `ffn_gate_inp`, `ffn_down_exps` and `ffn_up_exps` as
//!   REQUIRED for every layer at or past the prefix, and creates
//!   `ffn_gate` / `ffn_up` / `ffn_down` for NO such layer. There is no
//!   `n_moe_layer_step` in that condition.
//! * `src/models/ernie4-5-moe.cpp:64` -- the graph -- runs the DENSE
//!   branch on a layer past the prefix whenever `(il + 1) % step != 0`,
//!   reading the `ffn_up`/`ffn_gate`/`ffn_down` the loader never
//!   created.
//!
//! The two agree only when every layer at or past the prefix satisfies
//! `(il + 1) % step == 0`, and that is exactly the case where the modulo
//! changes nothing. There is no configuration in which the interleave
//! interleaves AND llama.cpp can load the file: a converter-produced
//! checkpoint puts `blk.N.ffn_gate.weight` on the interleaved dense
//! layers, and llama.cpp dies on the missing `blk.N.ffn_down_exps.weight`.
//! `tests/one_match_arm_graphs.rs` ships the two-step fixture that
//! demonstrates it.
//!
//! Every real ERNIE-4.5 MoE export therefore carries a step of 1:
//! `conversion/ernie.py:88` writes `moe_layer_interval` straight from
//! the HF config, and both published checkpoints
//! (`ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B`, `ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B`) set it to 1, at which
//! point `(il + 1) % 1 == 0` for every layer and the rule collapses to
//! the leading-dense prefix ferrox already implements and has now
//! evidenced against libllama.
//!
//! So the arm is a REFUSAL rather than an implementation: ferrox runs
//! the files that exist and stops, by name, on the shape that no
//! reference can confirm. Implementing the modulo would have added a
//! decode path that no loadable checkpoint reaches and no golden run
//! could check.
//!
//! # The one loader that HONOURS the step
//!
//! `grep -n n_moe_layer_step src/models/*.cpp` over all 155 graphs is
//! the two ERNIE lines above and `llama4.cpp:6,64`. Llama 4 reads the
//! key as REQUIRED (`:6`) and its TENSOR LOADER branches on it
//! (`:64`, `is_moe_layer = n_moe_layer_step > 0 && (i + 1) % step ==
//! 0`, the routed triple plus a shared expert on those layers and the
//! dense triple on the rest, `:77-94`), so a Llama 4 file whose step
//! interleaves loads upstream, and its graph branches on the router's
//! presence (`:202`). Scout and Maverick export step 1 (every layer
//! MoE); `interleave_moe_layer_step: 2` is Llama-4's config for the
//! shape the fixture takes. [`INTERLEAVE_STEP_HONOURED_BY_LOADER`] is
//! that one row, [`interleave_step`] its answer, and
//! `ModelConfig::layer_is_dense` the ONE place the modulo is spelled.
//! A step of 0 there makes every layer dense with `n_expert` still
//! nonzero, a file no converter writes and no fixture has a golden
//! for; it is refused by name rather than served unmeasured.
