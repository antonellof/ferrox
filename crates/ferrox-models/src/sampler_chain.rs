//! llama.cpp's sampler chain, as the shrinking candidate list it
//! actually is.
//!
//! Every sampler in `src/llama-sampler.cpp` takes one
//! `llama_token_data_array` -- a list of `(token id, logit, p)` -- and
//! **removes entries from it**. The next sampler in the chain then sees
//! only the survivors, and any sampler that needs probabilities calls
//! `llama_sampler_softmax_impl` (`:293`), which renormalises **over the
//! survivors only**.
//!
//! That renormalisation is the part a "just zero the logits you don't
//! want" implementation silently gets wrong, and ferrox's did. With
//! `--top-k 40 --top-p 0.95`, llama.cpp's top-p sums probabilities that
//! were divided by the mass of the top 40; ferrox summed probabilities
//! divided by the mass of the **whole vocabulary**, which is larger, so
//! its running sum crossed 0.95 later and it kept MORE tokens than
//! llama.cpp for the same two flags. Same idea as the temperature-order
//! bug: not a reordering of independent steps, a different candidate
//! set.
//!
//! So this module models the candidate list rather than a keep-mask,
//! and each filter here is a transcription of the corresponding
//! `_apply` in llama.cpp, cited at its definition.
//!
//! **`min_keep`.** Several of llama.cpp's filters take a `min_keep`
//! floor and guard their cutoff with `i + 1 >= min_keep`. ferrox has no
//! such parameter (llama.cpp's own CLI does not expose one either --
//! `common/arg.cpp` has no `--min-keep`; only the server's JSON body
//! carries it), and `common_params_sampling::min_keep` defaults to `0`
//! (`common/common.h:228`), which makes every one of those guards
//! vacuously true. They are therefore folded out below rather than
//! carried as a field nothing sets.
