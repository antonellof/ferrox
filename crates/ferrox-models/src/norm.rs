//! The normalisation at ONE site in a decoder: before the attention
//! branch, before the FFN branch, or before the LM head.
//!
//! Three variants, because llama.cpp's `build_norm`
//! (`llama-graph.cpp`) has three answers at those sites and ferrox used
//! to have one. It takes a norm TYPE (`LLM_NORM` = LayerNorm,
//! `LLM_NORM_RMS` = RMSNorm) and a weight that may be null, and applies
//! the multiply only `if (mw)`. Everything below is a reading of that
//! function and of the three graphs that reach its corners.
//!
//! ```text
//! // the ordinary case, and nearly every architecture on the generic path
//! ffn_inp = x       + attn(rms(x, attn_norm))
//! out     = ffn_inp + ffn(rms(ffn_inp, ffn_norm))
//! ```
//!
//! Gemma-2 added a *sandwich*: the same two pre-norms, plus a norm on
//! each branch's OUTPUT before its residual add. ferrox has carried
//! those two as [`crate::decoder::AttnWeights::post_attn_norm`] and
//! [`crate::decoder::AttnWeights::post_ffn_norm`] for a long time, and
//! they are not this type -- they are `Option<Vec<f32>>` RMSNorms, and
//! no architecture has ever wanted anything else there.
//!
//! # [`NormOp::None`]: `olmo2` and `exaone4`
//!
//! **The sandwich with the bread taken off.** They have the two
//! post-norms and NO pre-norms at all, and both sublayers read the raw
//! residual:
//!
//! ```text
//! ffn_inp = x       + post_attn_norm(attn(x))
//! out     = ffn_inp + post_ffn_norm(ffn(ffn_inp))
//! ```
//!
//! That claim is a reading of both files, not a family resemblance:
//!
//! | | `src/models/olmo2.cpp` | `src/models/exaone4.cpp` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | per-layer norms created | `attn_q_norm`, `attn_k_norm`, `attn_post_norm`, `ffn_post_norm` (:45-52) | `attn_post_norm`, `attn_q_norm`, `attn_k_norm`, `ffn_post_norm` (:60-67) |
//! | `attn_norm` | absent | absent |
//! | `ffn_norm` | absent | absent |
//! | Q/K/V read | `cur = inpL` (:92) | `cur = inpL` (:118) |
//! | attention output | `build_norm(cur, attn_post_norm)` (:160-163) | `build_norm(cur, attn_post_norm)` (:152) |
//! | `ffn_inp` | `add(cur, inpSA)` (:165) | `add(cur, inpSA)` (:155) |
//! | FFN input | `build_ffn(ffn_inp, ...)` (:169) | `build_ffn(ffn_inp, ...)` (:159) |
//! | FFN output | `build_norm(cur, ffn_post_norm)` (:177-179) | `build_norm(cur, ffn_post_norm)` (:166) |
//! | residual | `add(cur, ffn_inp)` (:182) | `add(cur, ffn_inp)` (:169) |
//!
//! Line for line the same graph. So the two rows share ONE
//! implementation -- this module -- rather than getting one arm each.
//! What they do NOT share is their QK-norm style (`olmo2` norms the 2-D
//! projection over its whole width, `exaone4` per head after
//! `build_qkv` has reshaped), which is why each still needs its own
//! fixture: `tests/post_norm_only_graphs.rs`.
//!
//! # [`NormOp::LayerNormNoParams`]: `olmo`, and only `olmo`
//!
//! OLMo-1 is a THIRD shape, and it is not about the residual at all.
//! `src/models/olmo.cpp:27-35` creates Q/K/V, `attn_output` and
//! gate/up/down and **not one norm tensor** -- no `attn_norm`, no
//! `ffn_norm`, no `output_norm` -- and its graph normalises at all
//! three sites with a null weight AND a null bias:
//!
//! ```text
//! // olmo.cpp:65-67, :104-106, :128-130
//! cur = build_norm(inpL, NULL, NULL, LLM_NORM, il);
//! ```
//!
//! `LLM_NORM` is `ggml_norm` (`llama-graph.cpp`'s `build_norm`), which
//! subtracts the mean and divides by the standard deviation
//! (`ggml/src/ggml-cpu/ops.cpp:3716-3745`); with both weight and bias
//! null, `build_norm` does nothing further. So it is a pre-norm layer
//! like `llama`, with a different norm FUNCTION and no parameters at
//! all. `NormOp::None` is no help here and neither is `NormOp::Rms`.
//!
//! **This is the only architecture in llama.cpp that does it.** Scanned
//! over every `build_norm` call in all 140 `src/models/*.cpp` graphs,
//! extracting the weight argument: three calls pass a null weight to
//! `LLM_NORM`, and all three are `olmo.cpp`. (`talkie.cpp` passes a null
//! weight to `LLM_NORM_RMS` at five sites, which is a different
//! function and a different row.) So this variant closes exactly one
//! refusal and the hoped-for shared cause is not there -- see
//! `capability::NON_PARAMETRIC_LAYER_NORM`, which says so where the next
//! person will look.
//!
//! # [`NormOp::LayerNorm`]: `dbrx`, the row that gave the variant a caller
//!
//! The LayerNorm FUNCTION is shared more widely than the parameterless
//! corner: `dbrx` and the `nemotron` / `orion` / `stablelm` /
//! `codeshell` / `jais2` / `starcoder` / `starcoder2` / `phimoe` group
//! all normalise with `LLM_NORM` and a learned weight. This variant was
//! deliberately NOT written beside `LayerNormNoParams`, because at that
//! point every one of those rows refused for more than the norm, and a
//! variant with no caller silently rots. `dbrx` is the caller:
//! `src/models/dbrx.cpp:69-71`, `:110-112` and `:140-142` are
//! `build_norm(x, w, NULL, LLM_NORM, il)` -- weight, no bias -- and its
//! other two blockers, `{arch}.attention.clamp_kqv` and a pre-FFN norm
//! stored as `blk.N.attn_output_norm`, took one implementation each
//! (`crate::clamp_kqv`, `crate::norm_sites`).
//!
//! **Weight but no bias, on purpose.** Every other row in that group
//! creates `*_norm.bias` as REQUIRED and `build_norm` adds it after the
//! multiply. That is a fourth variant, `LayerNorm(w, b)`, and it is
//! absent for the reason this one was absent before `dbrx`: no admitted
//! row calls it. [`NormFunction`] is where the choice is made per
//! architecture; a bias means a variant there and at every match on
//! this enum, which is the compile error that is wanted.
//!
//! # Why this is a type and not a `bool` on `ModelConfig`
//!
//! The RMSNorm weights are handed to fused Metal kernels that apply the
//! norm INSIDE the kernel (`PrefillDenseLayerMetal::attn_norm_w`,
//! `MoeLayerMetal::ffn_norm_w`, `launch_decode_dense_layer`). A flag on
//! the config would leave every one of those launches free to keep
//! reading a `&[f32]` that no longer means anything, and nothing would
//! fail: that is precisely this repo's dominant bug shape, two
//! structures that must agree with nothing enforcing it, and it is how
//! `post_attn_norm` was lost from a decode path once already.
//!
//! Making the slot an enum instead means a fused launch cannot compile
//! until it has said what it does when there is no weight to hand over.
//! [`NormOp::rms_weights`] returns `None` for BOTH non-RMS variants, and
//! every GPU call site turns that into a fall-back to the host body,
//! which computes the right thing. The disagreement is a type error
//! rather than a silent wrong answer. `Decoder::final_norm` is this type
//! for the same reason: `olmo` is the first architecture whose FINAL
//! norm is not an RMSNorm either, and the fused stacks that fold
//! `final_norm + lm_head + argmax` had `Some(&self.final_norm)` written
//! into them unconditionally.
