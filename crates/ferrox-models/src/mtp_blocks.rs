//! **NextN / MTP blocks are inside `block_count`, and are not layers.**
//!
//! A multi-token-prediction head is exported as one or more EXTRA
//! decoder blocks appended after the trunk -- each with its own
//! `attn_norm`, QKV, `wo`, `ffn_norm`, experts, PLUS the `nextn.*`
//! tensors that make it a speculative head (`eh_proj`, `enorm`, `hnorm`,
//! `shared_head_*`, `embed_tokens`). The converters count them in
//! `block_count` (`conversion/mimo.py:22`, `step3.py:117-119`,
//! `exaone.py:132,224`, `glm.py:99,116`, `deepseek.py:457,525`) and
//! write `{arch}.nextn_predict_layers` beside it.
//!
//! llama.cpp never runs them as layers:
//!
//! - `llama-model.cpp:1092` reads `block_count` into `n_layer_all`;
//! - `llama-hparams.cpp:280-282` defines `n_layer()` as
//!   `n_layer_all - n_layer_nextn`;
//! - `llama-graph.cpp:1433` builds every graph with `n_layer =
//!   hparams.n_layer()`, so `mimo2.cpp:108`, `step35.cpp:205`,
//!   `glm4-moe.cpp:161`, `deepseek2.cpp:470` loop over the trunk only;
//! - each tensor loader loops `0..n_layer_all` and creates the blocks
//!   at `i >= n_layer` with `TENSOR_SKIP` (`exaone4.cpp:43-49`,
//!   `mimo2.cpp:35-37,51-52`) unless the context was opened as an MTP
//!   draft (`load_mtp`), so the bytes are neither read nor missed.
//!
//! **Only the graphs that READ the key subtract.** Measured: `grep -l
//! LLM_KV_NEXTN_PREDICT_LAYERS src/models/*.cpp` is the seventeen in
//! [`NEXTN_READERS`]. For any other architecture `n_layer_nextn` stays
//! 0, every block runs, and a file carrying `nextn.*` tensors fails
//! llama.cpp's own "not all tensors loaded" check -- so for those a
//! nonzero key is refused here rather than honoured. Until 2026-09-11
//! ferrox refused it for EVERY architecture (`capability::
//! unsupported_feature_keys`), which was safe and over-broad: every
//! real MiMo-V2 (`mimo.py:167`, three blocks), Step-3.5 (`step3.py:223`,
//! three), K-EXAONE (`exaone.py:146`, one), GLM-4.5/4.6 (`glm.py:106`,
//! one) and DeepSeek-V3 (`deepseek.py:498`, one) export carries the key
//! with a nonzero value.
//!
//! **The order of the two reads matters, and is copied.** `exaone4.cpp:4`
//! tests `n_layer() == 64` BEFORE `:18` reads the key, and
//! `mimo2.cpp:12` / `step35.cpp:26` size the sliding-window array by
//! `n_layer()` before `:19` / `:32` read it, so both see `n_layer_all`.
//! The loader therefore feeds `block_count` -- [`TrunkLayers::
//! block_count`], not [`TrunkLayers::n_layers`] -- to
//! `capability::swa_disabled_by_arch` and to every per-layer array
//! length check, and only the trunk to the layer loop. A hypothetical
//! EXAONE-4.5 with 64 trunk layers and one MTP block gets NO window in
//! llama.cpp, and gets none here.
//!
//! This module decides the trunk once ([`trunk_layers`]) and marks the
//! skipped blocks' tensors as deliberately unread
//! ([`note_mtp_blocks_skipped`]) so that `loader::
//! assert_every_tensor_consumed` -- which exists precisely to catch a
//! tensor nobody read -- can tell "skipped on purpose, as llama.cpp
//! does" from "missing from the graph". The four dedicated engines
//! (`glm52_gguf_loader`, `mla_gguf_loader`, `hybrid_gguf_loader`,
//! `gemma4_gguf_loader`) take their layer count from the same function:
//! three of the four own architectures in [`NEXTN_READERS`] and read
//! `block_count` verbatim before this, so a real GLM-4.5 or DeepSeek-V3
//! file would have run its MTP block as one more decoder layer with the
//! `nextn.*` tensors silently unread.
