//! `{arch}.attention.clamp_kqv`, for the architectures whose graph
//! applies it.
//!
//! `LLM_KV_ATTENTION_CLAMP_KQV` (`llama-arch.cpp:231`) is a symmetric
//! clamp on the Q, K and V projections, applied INSIDE the shared
//! `build_qkv` rather than in any one architecture's graph:
//!
//! ```text
//! // llama-graph.cpp:1611-1612, and again at :1631, :1641, :1651
//! if (hparams.f_clamp_kqv > 0.0f) {
//!     qkv = ggml_clamp(ctx0, qkv, -hparams.f_clamp_kqv, hparams.f_clamp_kqv);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The fused branch clamps the fused projection once; the split branch
//! clamps `Qcur`, `Kcur` and `Vcur` separately. Either way it happens
//! AFTER the bias add and before the reshape, before any QK-norm and
//! before RoPE. `build_qkv` clamps for ANY architecture whose
//! `f_clamp_kqv` is positive, but only three `load_arch_hparams` read
//! the key, so for every other architecture the key is dead metadata
//! and ferrox ignores it the same way.
//!
//! **Three architectures read the key**, and no other: `dbrx.cpp:5`
//! (REQUIRED -- no `false` argument, so a DBRX file without the key is
//! refused by llama.cpp's loader), `mpt.cpp:5` and `olmo.cpp:5` (both
//! optional). `mpt` never reaches the generic decoder (ALiBi), so this
//! module serves `olmo` and `dbrx`. It is live for both: the DBRX
//! converter writes `attn_config.clip_qkv` unconditionally
//! (`conversion/dbrx.py:28`, and every DBRX checkpoint sets it to 8),
//! and `conversion/olmo.py:23-25` writes the key whenever the HF config
//! has a `clip_qkv`, which OLMo-7B-Twin-2T and OLMo-1.7-7B do (`8.0`)
//! and the original OLMo-7B does not (`null`).
//!
//! **This used to be a refusal**, and the reason it was one is the
//! reason for the shape of the implementation. The projections are
//! computed in the CPU decode body, the prefill body and the
//! continuous-batching body, and each of those applied the QKV bias in
//! its own hand-written loop; a clamp added to some of them and not the
//! others would have been this repo's single most expensive defect
//! shape. So the three bias loops collapsed onto ONE helper,
//! `Decoder::apply_qkv_bias_and_clamp` (`decoder/qkv_bias.rs`), and the
//! clamp lives in that helper after the bias, where `build_qkv` puts
//! it. The fused Metal launches apply the bias inside their kernels via
//! `AttnExtras` and have no clamp, so `Decoder::metal_can_serve_model`
//! -- the one predicate every Metal eligibility check reads -- keeps a
//! clamped model on the host bodies rather than letting two backends
//! answer differently from the same weights.
//!
//! The evidence is `tests/olmo_graphs.rs`
//! (`olmo_clamped_tiny.gguf`, whose llama.cpp logits differ measurably
//! from the unclamped file's) and `tests/dbrx_graphs.rs`.
