//! **THE PARALLEL RESIDUAL** -- `x + attn(norm(x)) + ffn(norm(x))`, the
//! layer shape the generic decoder does not have, and which of llama.cpp's
//! graphs build it.
//!
//! # What it is
//!
//! The generic layer is sequential: `h = x + attn(norm1(x))`, then
//! `h + ffn(norm2(h))`. The parallel shape feeds the FFN the LAYER INPUT
//! -- normed -- rather than the attention output, and sums the three
//! terms once. Two spellings exist upstream:
//!
//! - **One shared norm** (`SharedNorm`): the FFN reads the SAME normed
//!   tensor attention read. `stablelm.cpp:135-137` (`cur = inpSA` when
//!   `ffn_norm` is ABSENT), `phi2.cpp:67,108,116-117`,
//!   `falcon.cpp:124-135` (Falcon-7B, no `attn_norm_2`),
//!   `command-r.cpp:68,106-119`, `cohere2.cpp:120-134`,
//!   `cohere2moe.cpp:222-266`, `plamo.cpp:59-64,97-98,111-112` (`cur =
//!   sa_inp`, over an RMSNorm).
//! - **Two norms** (`TwoNorms`): `x + attn(ln1(x)) + ffn(ln2(x))`,
//!   `gptneox.cpp:143-166` (`use_parallel_residual`, read at `:5`) and
//!   `falcon.cpp:79-85` (Falcon-40B, `attn_norm_2`).
//!
//! # Reach -- MEASURED
//!
//! Over all 140 `src/models/*.cpp` (2026-09-12): `grep -l "par_res\|
//! parallel residual"` is `gptneox.cpp` and `stablelm.cpp`; a scan for
//! TWO consecutive `cur = ggml_add(ctx0, cur, ...)` lines -- the
//! three-term sum spelled out -- is `cohere2`, `cohere2moe` (twice, the
//! trunk and its MTP block), `command-r`, `falcon`, `phi2` and `plamo`,
//! with `gptneox` and `stablelm` separating their two adds by a `cb`
//! line. `gemma4.cpp:260` names an `attn_out` that is ALREADY `cur +
//! inpL`, so it is sequential and not in the table. Eight graphs, two
//! spellings, and `stablelm` is the one where BOTH shapes sit behind one
//! architecture string, decided by tensor presence. (`plamo` was missed
//! by a first grep that looked for `attn_out` by name; its attention
//! output is `sa_out`. The two-adds scan is the measurement.)
//!
//! # How it is served
//!
//! The sequential bodies already compute `h = x + attn(attn_norm(x))`
//! and then `h + ffn(normed2)`; `(x + attn) + ffn` IS the three-term
//! sum, so the parallel shape differs from the sequential one in
//! exactly one thing: WHAT `normed2` is. Sequential: `ffn_norm(h)`.
//! Parallel: a norm of `x`, the LAYER INPUT, which attention has
//! already been added on top of by the time the FFN body runs. So the
//! FFN input is captured BEFORE attention, at the same point
//! `crate::router_input` captures the router's operand, and the two
//! travel together as `decoder::ffn_block::BranchInputs` -- one
//! constructor, `Decoder::branch_inputs`, called at the top of every
//! layer of every host body, so a body cannot take one and forget the
//! other. `MoeWeights::parallel` is the per-layer fact (the `stablelm`
//! row is decided per layer, as `stablelm.cpp:129` decides it), and
//! for a `SharedNorm` layer the pre-FFN slot is `NormOp::None`,
//! because there is no tensor and the norm was applied when attention
//! took its input. `ModelConfig::parallel_residual` is the model-level
//! fact `Decoder::metal_can_serve_model` reads: every fused Metal
//! launch bakes `ffn_norm` over the post-attention residual into its
//! kernel, so a model with a parallel layer stays on the host bodies.
//!
//! Evidence (`tests/parallel_residual_graphs.rs`): `gptneox` under the
//! key, both values, and `plamo`, against libllama; the `stablelm`
//! shape that was refused by this module for one PR
//! (`tests/stablelm_graphs.rs`) matches now. `use_parallel_residual`
//! is read by `gptneox.cpp:5` and by NOTHING in `stablelm.cpp`
//! (libllama's logits with and without it are byte-identical there,
//! measured), which is why `stablelm`'s rule is the tensor and
//! `gptneox`'s is the key.
