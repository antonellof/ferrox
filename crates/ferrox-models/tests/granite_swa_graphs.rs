//! `granite_swa` (Granite 4.1) against libllama: the per-layer RoPE
//! PATTERN the file carries, and the seams that had to hold with it.
//!
//! `granite_swa` landed upstream after the 2026-08-04 llama.cpp pin and
//! was triaged NEW CODE on 2026-09-19 for two small per-layer tables.
//! One of them is the reason this suite exists:
//! `{arch}.attention.rope_pattern` (`src/models/granite-swa.cpp:43`,
//! read back at `:212` through `llama_hparams::has_rope`,
//! `llama-hparams.cpp:333-343`) is one entry per layer, nonzero meaning
//! "this layer rotates" -- and it is the FIRST upstream graph that lets
//! the FILE decide that. Every other per-layer RoPE gate in
//! `ferrox_models::rope_layers` is a rule read out of a literal:
//! `exaone-moe`'s `is_swa(il)`, `smollm3`'s `(il + 1) % 4`, `cohere2`'s
//! window. `grep -rn LLM_KV_ATTENTION_ROPE_PATTERN src/models/*.cpp`
//! over the 155 graphs is that one line, so
//! `RopeLayers::FileMask` is built for this architecture and for
//! nothing else -- upstream seeds the array with 1 for every model
//! (`llama-model.cpp:1314`) and only this graph reads it back, so
//! honouring the key elsewhere would answer differently from llama.cpp
//! on a file that carries it as dead metadata.
//!
//! **The two arrays disagree on purpose.** The fixture's window array
//! is `[true, false, true, true]` and its rope pattern is
//! `[1, 1, 0, 1]`, so layer 1 is the full-attention layer and layer 2
//! is the unrotated one. A loader that read either array into the
//! other's field would rotate the wrong layer and mask the wrong one,
//! and the golden would catch it -- which a fixture where both arrays
//! agree could not.
//!
//! What else the fixture carries, each a seam that already existed and
//! each now with one more name in its table:
//!
//!   * Granite's four scalar multipliers (`:7-10`; `logit_scale` is
//!     REQUIRED and DIVIDED at `:192`, the residual scale is applied to
//!     BOTH branch outputs at `:247-249,308-310`,
//!     `ferrox_models::scalar_multipliers`),
//!   * the sliding-window BOOL ARRAY read with `get_arr` (`:17`,
//!     `ferrox_models::swa_layers`), with a window of 3 against a
//!     six-token prompt,
//!   * REQUIRED per-layer attention sinks `{n_head}` (`:81`), one extra
//!     logit per head in the softmax,
//!   * all four OPTIONAL projection biases (`:79,100-102`,
//!     `ferrox_models::proj_bias`),
//!   * a `kq_scale` taken from `attention.scale` rather than
//!     `1/sqrt(head_dim)` (`:231`).
//!
//! **Where the numbers come from.** The golden was produced by running
//! llama.cpp's own graph over the fixture through
//! `scripts/gptoss_reference_logits.cpp`, linked against a libllama
//! built from `.scratch/llama.cpp` at the moved pin (`5b59b83`).
//!
//! ```text
