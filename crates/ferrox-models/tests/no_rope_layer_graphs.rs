//! The PER-LAYER-RoPE group, checked against llama.cpp itself.
//!
//! Three rows on ONE rule. llama.cpp gates rotation per layer in six
//! architectures (`ferrox_models::rope_layers` has the table and the
//! lines), and ferrox had no way to say so, which cost:
//!
//! * `exaone-moe` an UNAUDITED refusal, triaged NEW CODE on exactly this
//!   and nothing else (`exaone-moe.cpp:136,155-161`);
//! * `smollm3` an OUTRIGHT refusal, in the "No RoPE at all" group beside
//!   the ALiBi architectures (`smollm3.cpp:5,69`);
//! * EXAONE-4 32B a refusal BY NAME in `loader.rs`, on
//!   `block_count == 64` (`exaone4.cpp:4-9,116`).
//!
//! **`exaone-moe` and `exaone4` are one rule, not two that look alike.**
//! `exaone4.cpp:116` is `use_rope = is_swa(il) || swa_type == NONE`;
//! `exaone-moe.cpp:136` is `is_local_layer = is_swa(il)`, and
//! `exaone-moe.cpp:4` sets `swa_type = LLAMA_SWA_TYPE_STANDARD`
//! unconditionally, which nails `exaone4`'s second disjunct to false.
//! Read side by side, :155-161 and :132-138 are the same two
//! `ggml_rope_ext` calls under the same predicate; the only thing that
//! differs is that `exaone4` reaches that predicate solely at 64
//! layers. So `RopeLayers::SlidingOnly` is one variant and both rows
//! take it, and this suite is what proves the shared body is right for
//! both rather than right for one and plausible for the other.
//!
//! `smollm3` is a DIFFERENT variant of the same enum --
//! `RopeLayers::NoRopeEvery`, `(il + 1) % 4 != 0`, no window involved
//! -- and it is the row where the rule is the ONLY thing: its graph is
//! otherwise the plain pre-norm llama one. The other five gated
//! architectures each carry the rule plus something else, so this
//! fixture is the one that isolates it.
//!
//! # What each fixture is shaped to catch
//!
//! Every fixture is at least FOUR layers, because every rule here has a
//! period of 4 and a shorter file would rotate every layer and be
//! evidence about nothing. The 32B fixture is exactly 64, because
//! `exaone4.cpp:4` tests EQUALITY. Each carries a sliding window
//! NARROWER than the six-token prompt where the graph has one, so the
//! mask is exercised rather than being a no-op.
//!
//! | fixture | layers | unrotated layers | why |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `exaone4_32b` | 64 | 3, 7, ..., 63 | `set_swa_pattern(4)` last-dense, then `is_swa(il)` |
//! | `exaone_moe` | 4 | 3 | the same, and layer 3 is also an MoE layer |
//! | `smollm3` | 4 | 3 | `(il + 1) % 4 == 0` |
//!
//! `exaone_moe` also carries every piece of MoE machinery its graph
//! uses -- leading dense, `exp_probs_b` drawn large enough to reorder
//! the top-k, a shared expert sized by
//! `expert_shared_feed_forward_length`, sigmoid gating from metadata,
//! `expert_weights_scale` and `_norm`, per-head QK-norm -- so "the MoE
//! half is fine" is measured here rather than asserted in a triage
//! verdict.
//!
//! # Where the numbers come from
//!
//! Each `GOLDEN` array was produced by running llama.cpp's own graph
//! for that architecture over the same fixture file, through
//! `scripts/gptoss_reference_logits.cpp` linked against a real
//! `libllama` built from `.scratch/llama.cpp`. Not by re-reading a spec,
//! and not by ferrox checking itself.
//!
//! Measured against that reference over `GRAPH_PROMPT`, all three
//! fixtures being F32 so no `vec_dot_type` question arises
//! (`report_kl_against_llama_cpp` prints this table):
//!
//! | arch | KL(llama.cpp \|\| ferrox) | max abs logit delta | top-1 |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `exaone4_32b` | 2.05e-12 | 3.93e-06 | agrees |
//! | `exaone_moe` | 1.43e-14 | 3.87e-07 | agrees |
//! | `smollm3` | 5.29e-15 | 2.31e-07 | agrees |
//!
//! The 64-layer row's delta is ten times the others' and still 2500x
//! under the tolerance: sixty-four residual adds accumulate more
//! ordering noise than four.
//!
//! That is float32 accumulation noise -- ggml blocks its matmuls and
//! ferrox does not -- and it is orders of magnitude under every
//! sabotage below, each of which is required to move the logits by more
//! than 1e-2.
//!
//! Regenerating (both halves must be redone together if a fixture
//! changes):
