//! Grok-1, checked against llama.cpp itself.
//!
//! `grok` was triaged NEW CODE, and its verdict named the MiniCPM
//! shape: `src/models/grok.cpp:5-12` seeds seven hyper-parameters
//! BEFORE `:14-27` let the file override them, so a Grok-1 export that
//! declares none of them is still scaled by all of them and a
//! key-presence gate sees an ordinary file. That is
//! `scalar_multipliers::MultiplierDefaults::Grok`, and it is why this
//! suite has TWO goldens: `GROK_GOLDEN` is for a file declaring NO key
//! -- the only fixture shape that can tell the hook from its absence --
//! and `GROK_DECLARED_GOLDEN` is for a file declaring every key at a
//! value nowhere near its default, which pins that the file still wins.
//! A hook merged the wrong way round agrees with llama.cpp on exactly
//! the files that prove it exists.
//!
//! What the verdict called new code turned out to be three seams that
//! had landed the day before, each extended by one column:
//!
//! - **The defaults hook**, plus two things MiniCPM did not need:
//!   `grok.cpp:211` MULTIPLIES by `logit_scale` (`LogitScaleUse::AsIs`),
//!   and the attention scale comes from a fifth key,
//!   `{arch}.attention.output_scale` (`AttentionScaleKey::OutputScale`),
//!   which the graph applies INSIDE its tanh softcap with
//!   `kq_scale = 1.0f` (`:137`, `llama-graph.cpp:2572-2582`) -- which is
//!   arithmetically `ModelConfig::attention_scale` plus the existing
//!   `attn_logit_softcap`, so no new attention code.
//! - **The norm-site table** (`crate::norm_sites`): `attn_output_norm`
//!   is Grok's POST-attention norm (`:143-148`), the same tensor name
//!   `dbrx` uses for its PRE-FFN norm, and `layer_output_norm` its
//!   post-FFN norm (`:75-78`, `:185-190`).
//! - **The softcap gate**: `capability::LOGIT_SOFTCAP_ARCHITECTURES`,
//!   because `conversion/grok.py:34` writes `attn_logit_softcapping` for
//!   every export and the generic refusal would have stopped all of them.
//!
//! Two keys Grok reads and llama.cpp never applies --
//! `router_logit_softcapping` (`:10,:20`) and
//! `attention.temperature_length` (`:23`; no other reference to either
//! field under `src/`, measured) -- are neither applied nor refused, and
//! the declared file carries both to prove it. Grok-2's parallel dense
//! FFN (`:171-184`) is `crate::parallel_dense_ffn`, served since
//! `arctic` closed on the same seam, and `grok_dense_ffn_tiny.gguf` is
//! checked in `tests/parallel_dense_ffn_graphs.rs`.
//!
//! **Tolerance.** This is a GeGLU row (`:165`, `LLM_FFN_GELU`), so it
//! is compared at [`GELU_TABLE_TOL`]: llama.cpp's CPU GELU is a 65536
//! entry f16 lookup table and ferrox's is exact. Measured rather than
//! assumed: with ferrox's GELU temporarily made to emulate the table
//! (round the input to f16, look up, round the output to f16) both
//! files agree with libllama to **1.0e-7 / 1.5e-7** (KL 7e-16 / 2e-15),
//! so the whole of the 6.3e-5 / 4.0e-5 gap below is the table.
//!
//! **Where the numbers come from.** Both goldens were produced by
//! running llama.cpp's own graph over the fixtures through
//! `scripts/gptoss_reference_logits.cpp` linked against a real
//! `libllama` built from `.scratch/llama.cpp`.
//!
//! Regenerating (all three files together):
//!
