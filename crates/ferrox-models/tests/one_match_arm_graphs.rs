//! The ONE-MATCH-ARM architectures, checked against llama.cpp itself.
//!
//! `capability.rs` triaged 46 unaudited architectures into four classes.
//! ONE MATCH ARM means one small, nameable piece missing -- an
//! activation, a norm slot, a routing flag, an ordering. Seven are
//! closed here. Each needed a different arm, and each fixture is built
//! so that getting THAT arm wrong is a large, obvious divergence rather
//! than a rounding difference:
//!
//! | arch | the arm | what would break |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `deepseek` | top-k weights are not renormalised | every routed token |
//! | `bailingmoe` | `leading_dense_block_count` is inert | layer 0 fails to load |
//! | `seed_oss` | pre-FFN norm lives in `post_attention_norm` | a whole RMSNorm on the wrong side of a residual |
//! | `maincoder` | QK norm AFTER RoPE | every layer's attention scores |
//! | `hunyuan-moe` | QK norm AFTER RoPE | every layer's attention scores |
//! | `hunyuan-dense` | NTK-alpha RoPE base rescale (and the same QK-norm order) | every position, on every layer |
//! | `ernie4_5-moe` | `interleave_moe_layer_step`, landed as a REFUSAL | see below |
//!
//! **One of the seven arms could not be implemented, and that is the
//! finding rather than a shortfall.** `ernie4_5-moe`'s interleave step
//! is real in llama.cpp's GRAPH (`ernie4-5-moe.cpp:64`) and absent from
//! llama.cpp's own TENSOR LOADER (`ernie4-5.cpp:49`), so the two agree
//! only where the step changes nothing and a genuinely interleaved
//! checkpoint cannot be loaded by llama.cpp at all -- measured, on the
//! two-step fixture this suite ships. The step every real checkpoint
//! carries is audited here; anything else is refused by name and the
//! refusal says why.
//!
//! **Where the numbers come from.** Each `GOLDEN` array below was
//! produced by running **llama.cpp's own graph** for that architecture
//! over the same fixture file, through `scripts/gptoss_reference_logits.cpp`
//! linked against a real `libllama`. Not by re-reading a spec, and not
//! by ferrox checking itself. That is the bar `AUDITED_GENERIC_GQA`
//! sets, and it is why these five moved off the refusal list rather
//! than merely having their verdicts reworded.
//!
//! Every fixture is a 2- or 3-layer synthetic checkpoint from
//! `scripts/make_<arch>_fixture.py`, fixed seed, byte-stable. The
//! scripts' docstrings carry the per-architecture reading of
//! `.scratch/llama.cpp/src/models/*.cpp` that each shape choice comes
//! from.
//!
//! Regenerating (both halves must be redone together if a fixture
//! changes):
//!
//! ```text

// the answer from `NO_TOPK_RENORMALIZE_ARCHITECTURES`, and the fixture
// has no such key for exactly that reason.

// --- hunyuan-dense: the NTK-alpha RoPE base rescale -----------------
//
// `hunyuan-dense` has no graph of its own: `src/models/models.h:1830-1834`
// derives `llama_model_hunyuan_dense` from `llama_model_hunyuan_vl` and
// reuses its hparams, its tensors and its graph, so the file to read is
// `src/models/hunyuan-vl.cpp`. It had two blockers and both are closed
// here.
//
// The arm: `:8-12` rescales the trained RoPE base by
// `alpha^(head_dim / (head_dim - 2))` when `{arch}.rope.scaling.alpha`
// is positive. That key is read for EVERY architecture at
// `llama-model.cpp:1186` and applied by exactly two graphs, which is why
// ferrox's `rope_ntk_alpha` is a named list and not a generic rule.
//
// The second half, per-head QK norm applied AFTER RoPE (`:56-66` rope,
// then `:73-81` norm), was already implemented as
// `Decoder::qk_norm_after_rope` for `maincoder` and `hunyuan-moe`; this
// row only had to be added to the list.
//
// WHAT THE VERDICT GOT WRONG, and the fixture is what found it: the
// triage cited `conversion/hunyuan.py:356` as the converter line that
// writes `{arch}.rope.scaling.alpha` for this architecture. That line is
// in `HunyuanVLTextModel`, whose `model_arch` is `HUNYUAN_VL` -- a
// different GGUF architecture string and a different, still-refusing
// row. The `HUNYUAN_DENSE` converter is `HunYuanModel` at :254-281, and
// it does the same arithmetic in PYTHON (`scaled_base = base * (alpha **
// (dim / (dim - 2)))`, :270) and writes the already-scaled value through
// `add_rope_freq_base`, with no alpha key at all. So on a converted file
// llama.cpp's :8-12 is a no-op. The fixture writes the key explicitly so
// that the arm ferrox implements is the arm the reference runs, and
// libllama prints `freq_base_train = 92100.8` for a file whose
// `rope.freq_base` is 500.

// --- ernie4_5-moe: the interleave step, and why it is a refusal -----
//
// The arm was meant to be `{arch}.interleave_moe_layer_step`, so that

//
//     il >= n_layer_dense_lead && (il + 1) % n_moe_layer_step == 0
//
// Building the fixture is what changed the answer. llama.cpp's TENSOR
// LOADER has no step in it: `src/models/ernie4-5.cpp:49` creates
// `ffn_gate_inp`, `ffn_down_exps` and `ffn_up_exps` as REQUIRED for
// every layer at or past `n_layer_dense_lead`, and creates the dense
// `ffn_gate`/`ffn_up`/`ffn_down` for none of them. The loader and the
// graph therefore agree only where the modulo changes nothing, and a
// checkpoint whose interleave really interleaves cannot be loaded by
// llama.cpp at all. Measured, not reasoned: the two-step fixture beside
// this one makes libllama print
//
//     check_tensor_dims: tensor 'blk.2.ffn_gate_inp.weight' not found
//
// Both published ERNIE-4.5 MoE checkpoints (21B-A3B, 300B-A47B) carry a
// step of 1 -- `conversion/ernie.py:88` writes `moe_layer_interval`
// straight from the HF config -- at which point the rule collapses to
// the leading-dense prefix ferrox already implements. That is the file
// the golden values below come from; anything else is refused by name
// in `moe_interleave`.
//
// The rest of the row was read too: SOFTMAX routing, HARDCODED at :90 --
// this architecture is NOT sigmoid-routed, whatever the gap inventory
// said -- with `norm_w = true` (:88) and an optional `exp_probs_b`
// selection bias (ernie4-5.cpp:53). The fixture carries neither
// `expert_gating_func` nor `expert_weights_norm`, so both have to come
// out of ferrox's architecture-name defaults.

// and read bias only under the split `attn_q.bias` / `attn_k.bias` /
// `attn_v.bias` names, so on a real ChatGLM2/3 checkpoint -- which sets
// `add_qkv_bias: true` -- all three projections ran unbiased. It
// loaded, and it answered fluently.
//
// This row was triaged FIXTURE-AWAY once and was WRONG; the correction

// rather than assuming them:
//
//   * PARTIAL RoPE. `chatglm.cpp:59-61` asserts only that the K and V

//     `conversion/chatglm.py:151` writes `rope_dimension_count` as
//     `head_dim * partial_rotary_factor`, the factor defaulting to 0.5.
//     The fixture rotates 4 of 8 dimensions.
//   * A FUSED gate+up SwiGLU (`chatglm.cpp:48`, `LLM_FFN_SWIGLU,
//     LLM_FFN_SEQ` at :128-133), which is phi3's call shape: gate is
//     the first half, up the second (`ggml_swiglu` non-swapped,
//     ggml/src/ggml-cpu/ops.cpp:3225-3229).
//
// It is also the row that closed the ONE-MATCH-ARM class. It did NOT

// --- qwen: the same bias, plus an arm nobody had named --------------
//
// `chatglm`'s verdict predicted that splitting the fused
// `attn_qkv.bias` "closes chatglm and qwen together". It was half
// right. The bias really is the same arm -- `qwen.cpp:28` creates
// `attn_qkv.bias` as REQUIRED (flag `0`, not `TENSOR_NOT_REQUIRED`,
// which is stronger than chatglm's optional one) -- but there is a
// SECOND fact the verdict did not name, found by building this fixture:
//
//     `qwen.cpp:33-35` sizes `ffn_gate`, `ffn_up` and `ffn_down` at
//     `n_ff / 2`.
//
// Qwen-1's `config.intermediate_size` counts gate and up together (HF's
// `QWenMLP`: `ff_dim_in = intermediate_size // 2`), and
// `conversion/qwen.py`'s `QwenModel` writes it through unchanged. It
// costs no logits -- ferrox loads the dense FFN by tensor name and uses
// each matrix's own shape -- but it made `expert_ffn_dim` twice the
// real width, which is what every memory estimate prices the FFN from.
// `FFN_LENGTH_COUNTS_GATE_AND_UP` in `loader.rs` is that arm, and the
// second test below is what compares the two numbers.
//
// Everything else was read against the C: NEOX RoPE over a WHOLE head
// (no converter writes `qwen.rope.dimension_count`, so
// llama-model.cpp:1200-1202 defaults `n_rot` to `n_embd_head_k`), MHA
// (the fused QKV is `{n_embd, n_embd * 3}`), `1/sqrt(n_embd_head)`
// (:92), ordinary `LLM_FFN_SILU, LLM_FFN_PAR` SwiGLU with a separate
// gate (:113), no QK-norm, no post-norms, no window, and a REQUIRED
// `output` with no tied fallback (:20).
