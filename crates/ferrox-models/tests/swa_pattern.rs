//! ferrox's per-architecture default sliding-window pattern, pinned
//! against llama.cpp's own `load_arch_hparams`.
//!
//! Same mechanism as `rope_layout.rs`, aimed at the same class of bug.
//! `{arch}.attention.sliding_window_pattern` is *optional* in a GGUF:
//! llama.cpp seeds the period from a per-architecture literal and only
//! lets the key override it. ferrox reads the key and, when it is
//! absent, falls back to `capability::default_swa_layout`.
//!
//! A missing entry in that table is not neutral. With no period,
//! `ModelConfig::layer_sliding_window` returns the window for *every*
//! layer, so the layers that should attend over the whole context see
//! only a window instead. The file loads, the model runs at full speed,
//! and it answers from a truncated history. That is a different model,
//! and nothing says so.
//!
//! `LLAMA_SWA_DEFAULTS` below is a mechanical transcription of every
//! `src/models/*.cpp` that seeds `swa_period` before
//! `ml.get_key_or_arr(LLM_KV_ATTENTION_SLIDING_WINDOW_PATTERN,
//! swa_period, false)`. Three llama.cpp spellings are deliberately
//! absent because none of them is a per-arch period:
//!
//! - `set_swa_pattern(0)` (`deepseek4.cpp:68`, `dflash.cpp:54`) — every
//!   layer sliding, which is already what ferrox does with no period.
//! - `set_swa_pattern(1)` (`phi3.cpp:23`) — no layer sliding, on a
//!   branch that has already zeroed `n_swa` and set `swa_type = NONE`.
//! - `get_key_or_arr(..., hparams.is_swa_impl, n_layer)` with no scalar
//!   seed (`gemma4`, `gemma4-assistant`, `step35`, `mimo2`, `dflash`) —
//!   a per-layer array in the file, so there is no default to pin.
//!
//! Regenerate by re-reading the reference; do not edit an entry to make
//! a failing test pass.
