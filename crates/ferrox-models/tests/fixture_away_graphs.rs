//! The FIXTURE-AWAY architectures, checked against llama.cpp itself.
//!
//! `capability.rs` triaged every unaudited refusal into four classes.
//! FIXTURE-AWAY is the class that says ferrox ALREADY builds this
//! architecture's graph and what is missing is EVIDENCE. That claim is
//! cheap to make and expensive to be wrong about, so this suite makes it
//! the same way `one_match_arm_graphs.rs` does: a tiny synthetic GGUF
//! whose golden values come from **llama.cpp's own graph** via a real
//! `libllama`, compared on all three forward paths.
//!
//! | arch | RoPE | what its fixture pins beyond the plain graph |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `internlm2` | NORM | the optional q/k/v projection biases |
//! | `xverse` | NORM | nothing else -- it is llama under another name |
//! | `ernie4_5` | NORM | `head_dim != n_embd / n_head` |
//! | `baichuan` | NORM | 32 layers, because llama.cpp picks ALiBi off the layer count |
//! | `exaone` | NEOX | a tied lm_head, and `head_dim != n_embd / n_head` |
//! | `gemma` | NEOX | the sqrt(n_embd) embedding scale, GeGLU, a tied lm_head |
//! | `bailingmoe2` | NEOX | fused QKV, per-head QK norm before RoPE, sigmoid-gated MoE |
//! | `plamo3` | NEOX | sandwich norms, a real sliding window, and a tensor name nobody else spells |
//!
//! One of the seven verdicts was WRONG, and building its fixture is what
//! found that. `plamo3` is the only architecture upstream that creates
//! `ATTN_POST_NORM` / `FFN_POST_NORM` through the two-argument `LLM_TN`
//! overload (`plamo3.cpp:52,55`), so it asks for
//! `blk.N.post_attention_norm` with NO `.weight`, and gguf-py emits
//! exactly that for it. ferrox read only the suffixed spelling, so it
//! could never have loaded a real PLaMo-3 checkpoint -- fail-closed, but
//! not "a fixture away". `load_norm_vec_either_spelling` in `loader.rs`
//! is the arm; this suite is the evidence it is the right one.
//!
//! **Every row was checked against the C on the six facts this repo has
//! lost at least once**, and every one of the six is asserted below
//! rather than merely read:
//!
//! 1. **RoPE variant.** `llama_model_rope_type` (llama-model.cpp) puts
//!    `internlm2` (:2579), `xverse` (:2581), `baichuan` (:2577) and
//!    `ernie4_5` (:2602) in the NORM group and `exaone` (:2655) in the
//!    NEOX group. `the_rope_variant_each_architecture_uses_is_the_one_llama_cpp_uses`
//!    pins the resolved layout and
//!    `rotating_the_wrong_pairs_diverges_from_llama_cpp` proves each
//!    fixture can see a flip. Getting this wrong is the Llama-3.1-8B
//!    wrong-output bug.
//! 2. **SWA pattern and phase.** Six of the seven read
//!    `LLM_KV_ATTENTION_SLIDING_WINDOW` nowhere at all:
//!    `internlm2.cpp:3-11`, `xverse.cpp:3-12`, `baichuan.cpp:3-15`,
//!    `ernie4-5.cpp:3-21`, `exaone.cpp:3-10` and `bailingmoe2.cpp:3-21`
//!    are the complete `load_arch_hparams` bodies and none mentions a
//!    window, so `hparams.swa_type` stays `LLAMA_SWA_TYPE_NONE` and
//!    there is no phase to get wrong. `plamo3` is the exception and
//!    gets the full treatment: `plamo3.cpp:5-11` reads the window and a
//!    scalar `sliding_window_pattern` and calls `set_swa_pattern` with
//!    `dense_first = false`, its fixture drives a period of 2 out of the
//!    file over four layers with a window NARROWER than the prompt, and
//!    the period, the phase and the window each have their own sabotage
//!    test.
//! 3. **`attention_scale`.** All seven pass a literal
//!    `1.0f/sqrtf(float(n_embd_head))` to `build_attn`
//!    (internlm2.cpp:92, xverse.cpp:90, baichuan.cpp:103,
//!    ernie4-5.cpp:120, exaone.cpp:93, bailingmoe2.cpp:141,
//!    plamo3.cpp:140) and none reads `LLM_KV_ATTENTION_SCALE`, so
//!    `ModelConfig::attention_scale` must stay `None` and let the
//!    kernels' own scale stand.
//! 4. **`post_attn_norm`** and **5. `post_ffn_norm`.** Six of the seven
//!    create neither `LLM_TENSOR_ATTN_POST_NORM` nor
//!    `LLM_TENSOR_FFN_POST_NORM`; each layer has exactly `attn_norm` and
//!    `ffn_norm`, both applied BEFORE their branch on a sequential
//!    residual. `plamo3` has BOTH, applied to their branch's OUTPUT
//!    before the residual add (:152-155, :171-174) -- the Gemma-2
//!    placement, which is where ferrox applies them -- and dropping
//!    either one has its own sabotage test.
//! 6. **QK-norm and its order.** None of the five DENSE rows creates
//!    `attn_q_norm` / `attn_k_norm`, so there is no ordering question
//!    for them. `bailingmoe2` does: `bailingmoe2.cpp:52-53` creates
//!    per-head norms of width `n_embd_head_k` and :123-135 applies them
//!    BEFORE `ggml_rope_ext`, the opposite of `maincoder` and
//!    `hunyuan-moe` next door. Its fixture's norm weights are centred
//!    near 1.5 so the two orders are far apart, and
//!    `norming_bailingmoe2_after_rope_instead_of_before_diverges_from_llama_cpp`
//!    proves it.
//!
//! The MoE half of the checklist -- the gating function, and whether the
//! top-k weights are renormalised after selection -- arises for
//! `bailingmoe2` alone (`plamo3` is dense). Both are REQUIRED-or-read metadata keys there
//! (`bailingmoe2.cpp:10-11`), the fixture carries both, and
//! `bailingmoe2_reads_its_routing_out_of_the_file_rather_than_guessing`
//! asserts what they resolved to. It matters because ferrox's
//! architecture-name fallback would default this row to SOFTMAX. For
//! the five dense rows the question does not arise at all, and
//! `only_bailingmoe2_is_moe` pins that rather than leaving it implied.
//!
//! **Where the numbers come from.** Each `GOLDEN` array was produced by
//! running llama.cpp's own graph for that architecture over the same
//! fixture file, through `scripts/gptoss_reference_logits.cpp` linked
//! against a real `libllama`. Not by re-reading a spec, and not by
//! ferrox checking itself.
//!
//! Regenerating (both halves must be redone together if a fixture
//! changes):

//
// The sandwich-norm row, the only one here with a sliding window, and
// the one whose FIXTURE-AWAY verdict turned out to be WRONG by one
// tensor name.
//
// `LLM_TN` appends `.weight` only when given a suffix
// (llama-arch.cpp:898-910), and every architecture that creates
// ATTN_POST_NORM / FFN_POST_NORM passes one -- except `plamo3`, which
// uses the two-argument overload (plamo3.cpp:52,55) and so asks for
// `blk.N.post_attention_norm` and `blk.N.post_ffw_norm` with NO suffix.
// gguf-py emits exactly those names for it, because its PLaMo mapping
// keys (tensor_mapping.py:368,434) already END in `.weight` and
// `get_type_and_name` (:2585-2594) tries an exact match before
// stripping a suffix. ferrox read only the suffixed spelling, so it
// could never have loaded a real PLaMo-3 checkpoint --
// `load_norm_vec_either_spelling` in `loader.rs` is the arm that fixes
// it, and this fixture uses the un-suffixed names because that is what
// a converter writes.
//
// The rest is slot for slot: attn_norm (:104), fused attn_qkv (:47) with
// head_dim decoupled from n_embd/n_head, per-head QK norm before RoPE
// (:49-50, :128-138), attn_post_norm on the attention output before its
// residual add (:152-155), ffn_norm (:160), a fused SwiGLU ffn_up of
// n_ff*2 with no ffn_gate (:57, :163-168), and ffn_post_norm on the FFN
// output before its add (:171-174). NEOX RoPE.
