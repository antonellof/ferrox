//! DBRX, checked against llama.cpp itself.
//!
//! `dbrx` was triaged NEW CODE on three blockers, and each turned out to
//! be one implementation that another row also needed -- the shape this
//! repo's honest position says the NEW CODE column moves on:
//!
//! 1. **LayerNorm with a learned weight and no bias.** `dbrx.cpp:4` reads
//!    `LLM_KV_ATTENTION_LAYERNORM_EPS` and the graph passes `LLM_NORM`
//!    with a weight and a null bias at all three sites (:69-71, :110-112,
//!    :140-142). `crate::norm::NormOp::LayerNorm` is the variant the
//!    OLMo-1 work deliberately left unwritten until a row called it. It
//!    reaches every site that norms, including the fused Metal stacks,
//!    because those ask `NormOp::rms_weights()` and fall back to the host
//!    body on `None`.
//! 2. **A REQUIRED QKV clamp.** `dbrx.cpp:5` reads
//!    `{arch}.attention.clamp_kqv` with no default, and
//!    `llama-graph.cpp:1611-1652` clamps the projection after the bias.
//!    `crate::clamp_kqv` implements it through the one helper every host
//!    body shares (`decoder/qkv_bias.rs`), which is what also closed the
//!    clip_qkv sub-refusal on `olmo`.
//! 3. **The pre-FFN norm under another name.** `dbrx.cpp:34` creates
//!    `attn_out_norm` and no `ffn_norm`, and `:110-113` norms `ffn_inp`
//!    with it. `crate::norm_sites` reads `blk.N.attn_output_norm` into the
//!    pre-FFN slot -- and reads the SAME tensor name into `grok`'s
//!    post-attention slot, which is why the table exists.
//!
//! **Where the numbers come from.** `DBRX_GOLDEN` was produced by
//! running llama.cpp's own graph over the fixture through
//! `scripts/gptoss_reference_logits.cpp` linked against a real
//! `libllama` built from `.scratch/llama.cpp`.
