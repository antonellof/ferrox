//! Turning KV-window eviction on must not change a single token.
//!
//! #61 step 2 lets a windowed layer's host `KvCache` drop rows that have
//! fallen behind its window. The argument that this is free is short --
//! a windowed kernel reads the last `window` rows and eviction never
//! drops one of those -- and short arguments about attention are exactly
//! the ones this repo has been wrong about before. So it is measured:
//! the same decoder, the same weights, the same prompt, greedily, with
//! the switch off and on, token for token.
//!
//! # Why a synthetic model and not gemma-2-2b
//!
//! The local alternating-SWA checkpoints have windows of 4096 (Gemma-2)
//! and 1024 (Gemma-3). Eviction cannot fire below that, so a test on one
//! of them would need a >4k-token prompt to prove anything and would
//! otherwise pass while exercising nothing -- the "the fixture has no
//! sliding layers" trap in a different costume. The window is a config
//! number, not a weights number, so this uses a real decoder with real
//! (random) weights and a 6-position window, where eviction fires 7
//! tokens in and every assertion below is about eviction rather than
//! about how long the test is willing to run.
//!
//! `kv_window_real_checkpoint.rs` is the same comparison through
//! gemma-2-2b's real Q4_K_M tensors, narrowing the window for the same
//! reason and skipping when the checkpoint is absent.
