//! The POST-NORM-ONLY family, checked against llama.cpp itself.
//!
//! `olmo2` and `exaone4` were both triaged NEW CODE in `capability.rs`
//! for the same blocker: neither has an `attn_norm` or an `ffn_norm`
//! tensor, both sublayers read the RAW residual, and each branch's
//! output is normed before its residual add.
//!
//! ```text
//! ffn_inp = x       + post_attn_norm(attn(x))
//! out     = ffn_inp + post_ffn_norm(ffn(ffn_inp))
//! ```
//!
//! **They are one topology, not two that look alike**, and the claim is
//! a line-by-line reading of both graphs rather than a family
//! resemblance -- `crate::norm`'s module docs carry the table. So
//! there is ONE implementation, `NormOp`, and this suite is what
//! proves the shared body is right for both rows rather than right for
//! one and plausible for the other.
//!
//! What the two rows do NOT share is their QK-norm style, which is why
//! they still need a fixture each:
//!
//! | | `olmo2` | `exaone4` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | QK-norm width | `{n_embd}` / `{n_head_kv * n_embd_head}` (olmo2.cpp:45-46) | `{n_embd_head_k}` (exaone4.cpp:61-62) |
//! | applied to | the 2-D projection, BEFORE `ggml_reshape_3d` (:106-116) | the 3-D tensor `build_qkv` already reshaped (:124-128) |
//! | ferrox style | `QkNormStyle::WholeVector` | `QkNormStyle::PerHead` |
//!
//! ferrox derives that style from the weight LENGTH at load
//! (`loader.rs`'s `refined_qk_norm`), so a fixture per style is the only
//! way to check the derivation against a real file of each shape.
//!
//! # What each fixture deliberately does NOT carry
//!
//! Both llama.cpp graphs have a second, per-layer RoPE behaviour that
//! ferrox cannot express, and in both cases llama.cpp switches it on
//! with NO GGUF key:
//!
//! * `exaone4.cpp:4-9` turns SWA on inside `if (n_layer() == 64)`, and
//!   :116 then ropes ONLY the sliding layers -- so EXAONE-4 32B gives
//!   its full-attention layers no rotation at all. Refused by name on
//!   `block_count == 64` in `loader.rs`, the `baichuan` precedent.
//! * `olmo2.cpp:120-134` ropes the sliding layers with the model's
//!   scaling switched off while :136-146 ropes the full ones with it on.
//!   Refused by name when a file carries BOTH a window and a
//!   `rope.scaling.type`.
//!
//! Both refusals have their own reachability tests in `loader.rs`
//! (`exaone4_32b_is_refused_because_its_full_attention_layers_get_no_rope`,
//! `olmo2_is_refused_only_when_it_has_a_window_and_a_rope_scaling_together`),
//! each with the negative half that proves the gate discriminates rather
//! than refusing the architecture outright. These two fixtures sit on
//! the other side of both lines, which is what makes them evidence about
//! the topology instead of evidence about a gate.
//!
//! `olmo` (OLMo-1) is a THIRD shape and is not in this suite: it norms
//! before both sublayers, so it is pre-norm like llama, and what it
//! lacks is a norm FUNCTION (non-parametric LayerNorm, `olmo.cpp:65-67`,
//! `:104-106`, all three `build_norm` calls with a NULL weight) rather
//! than the residual shape. It stays refused, and its triage row says so.
//!
//! **Where the numbers come from.** Each `GOLDEN` array was produced by
//! running llama.cpp's own graph for that architecture over the same
//! fixture file, through `scripts/gptoss_reference_logits.cpp` linked
//! against a real `libllama` built from `.scratch/llama.cpp`. Not by
//! re-reading a spec, and not by ferrox checking itself.
//!
//! Measured against that reference over `GRAPH_PROMPT`, both fixtures
//! being F32 so no `vec_dot_type` question arises:
//!
//! | arch | KL(llama.cpp \|\| ferrox) | max abs logit delta | top-1 |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `olmo2` | 3.01e-14 | 6.74e-07 | agrees |
//! | `exaone4` | 1.24e-14 | 3.91e-07 | agrees |
//!
//! That is float32 accumulation noise -- ggml blocks its matmuls and
//! ferrox does not -- and it is six orders of magnitude under every
//! sabotage below, each of which is required to move the logits by more
//! than 1e-2.
//!
//! Regenerating (both halves must be redone together if a fixture
//! changes):
//!
