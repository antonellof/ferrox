//! The Granite family, checked against llama.cpp itself.
//!
//! `granite`, `granitemoe` and ferrox's `granite-moe` alias were all
//! triaged NEW CODE against ONE cause: four scalar MULTIPLIERS that
//! `src/models/granite.cpp` applies and the generic decoder did not.
//! They are hyper-parameters rather than tensors, so
//! `assert_every_tensor_consumed` cannot see them and a Granite
//! checkpoint would have loaded, run at full speed, and answered at a
//! scale it was never trained at. ferrox refused such a file by name
//! instead, and this suite is the evidence that replaced that refusal.
//!
//! | key | where llama.cpp applies it | ferrox |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `{arch}.embedding_scale` | `llama-graph.cpp:2337-2342`, the shared `build_inp_embd` | `ModelConfig::embedding_scale` |
//! | `{arch}.attention.scale` | `granite.cpp:225`, as `kq_scale`, with a `0.0f` "unset" sentinel | `ModelConfig::attention_scale` |
//! | `{arch}.residual_scale` | `granite.cpp:235-238` and `:288-292`, on BOTH branch outputs | `ModelConfig::residual_scale` |
//! | `{arch}.logit_scale` | `granite.cpp:180`, as `1.0f / f_logit_scale` | `ModelConfig::logit_multiplier` |
//!
//! **One implementation, not one per architecture.**
//! `src/models/granite-moe.cpp` has NO graph: `models.h:1583-1591` is
//! `using graph = llama_model_granite::graph`, so the MoE row runs the
//! dense row's graph and takes its `ffn_gate_inp != nullptr` branch. The
//! two differ in the FFN and in nothing else. `crate::scalar_multipliers`
//! therefore carries one `MultiplierSupport` constant for all three
//! rows, and `capability::unsupported_scaling_keys` -- the list that
//! still refuses these keys everywhere else -- is DERIVED from that same
//! table rather than restated beside it.
//!
//! **The `granite-moe` alias.** `llama-arch.cpp:101` spells the
//! architecture `granitemoe`; no GGUF anywhere says `granite-moe`, so
//! there is no libllama golden for it and there never can be. Its
//! evidence is a second fixture, written from the same script with the
//! same seed and the same weights, differing only in the architecture
//! string and therefore in every key prefix, asserted against
//! `granitemoe`'s libllama golden. An alias nothing outside ferrox
//! exercises is exactly the row that drifts unnoticed, and one golden
//! read by both files is the only thing that stops it.
//!
//! **The six facts this repo has lost at least once**, checked against
//! the C for both rows and asserted below rather than merely read:
//!
//! 1. **RoPE variant.** `llama_model_rope_type` (llama-model.cpp:2594-2595)
//!    puts `LLM_ARCH_GRANITE` and `LLM_ARCH_GRANITE_MOE` in the
//!    consecutive-pairs NORM group.
//! 2. **SWA pattern and phase.** Neither `granite.cpp:5-45` nor
//!    `granite-moe.cpp:3-24` reads `LLM_KV_ATTENTION_SLIDING_WINDOW` at
//!    all, so `hparams.swa_type` stays `LLAMA_SWA_TYPE_NONE` and there
//!    is no phase to get wrong.
//! 3. **`attention_scale`.** This is the row where it is REAL rather
//!    than absent: `granite.cpp:225` passes `f_attention_scale` as
//!    `kq_scale` whenever it is non-zero. Both fixtures declare it, and
//!    it is 0.9 against the kernels' own `1/sqrt(6) = 0.408`.
//! 4. **`post_attn_norm`** and 5. **`post_ffn_norm`.** Neither row
//!    creates `LLM_TENSOR_ATTN_POST_NORM` or `LLM_TENSOR_FFN_POST_NORM`
//!    (`granite.cpp:48-107`); each layer has exactly `attn_norm` and
//!    `ffn_norm`, both applied BEFORE their branch.
//! 6. **QK-norm and its order.** Neither row creates `attn_q_norm` or
//!    `attn_k_norm`, so the ordering question does not arise.
//!
//! The MoE half of the checklist arises for `granitemoe` alone:
//! `granite.cpp:266-277` passes `norm_w = true` (the top-k weights ARE
//! renormalised), `LLAMA_EXPERT_GATING_FUNC_TYPE_SOFTMAX`, and
//! `hparams.expert_weights_scale` -- which neither Granite
//! `load_arch_hparams` reads, so it keeps its `0.0f` default and
//! `llama-graph.cpp:2070` treats that as no scaling. Its shared expert
//! (`:280-287`) is UNGATED, unlike qwen2moe's.
//!
//! **Where the numbers come from.** Each `GOLDEN` array was produced by
//! running llama.cpp's own graph for that architecture over the same
//! fixture file, through `scripts/gptoss_reference_logits.cpp` linked
//! against a real `libllama` built from `.scratch/llama.cpp`. Not by
//! re-reading a spec, and not by ferrox checking itself.
//!
//! Regenerating (both halves must be redone together if a fixture
//! changes):
