/// 1. The router input is normalized by a **weightless** RMSNorm. No
///    learned per-channel scale, unlike every other norm in the stack.
///    Reusing a weighted `rms_norm` here silently applies whatever
///    weight vector happened to be at hand.
/// 2. The normalized state is multiplied by a learned `router_scale`
///    vector, **and** by `hidden^-0.5`. The second factor is a
///    function of the width alone, so it is easy to omit and impossible
///    to notice: it rescales every logit by the same constant, which
///    changes the softmax temperature over the selected experts and
///    therefore the mixing weights, while leaving the top-k selection
///    itself identical.
/// 3. Selection is by **raw logit**, and the softmax runs over just the
///    selected `k`. That is not the same as softmaxing all experts and
///    slicing (see [`route_top_k_softmax`], where the surviving weights
///    sum to less than one); here they sum to exactly one.
/// 4. Each selected weight is then multiplied by
///    `per_expert_scale[expert_id]` -- a per-expert rescale applied to
///    the ROUTING WEIGHT rather than to the expert's output. No other
///    family here has it, and after it the weights no longer sum to
///    one, which is correct and must not be "fixed" by renormalizing.
///
/// `hidden` is the router's input; `router_weight` is the router
/// projection's output for it (one logit per expert, already computed
/// by the caller from the scaled state -- see
