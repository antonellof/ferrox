//! What the host was doing while a benchmark ran.
//!
//! `benchmarks/RESULTS.md` is only meaningful if every row was measured
//! on a quiet box. The plan's measurement contract puts the bar at a
//! 1-minute load average of ~2.0 and records why: known-good rows read
//! 25-45% low under load, which is wider than most of the gaps being
//! chased. That rule was written down and then broken anyway, because
//! nothing enforced it -- a 40-repetition run once went out at load
//! 208, producing 40 repetitions of noise.
//!
//! So the numbers are read here, the run refuses by default above the
//! bar, and both the start and end readings go into the receipt. A
//! receipt that cannot say how loaded or how hot the host was cannot be
//! audited later.
//!
//! Everything in this module keeps "we could not tell" distinct from
//! any particular value. `None` is never a stand-in for `0.0` load or
//! for nominal temperature: "the host was idle / cool" and "we could
//! not tell" are different facts, and a receipt that conflates them
//! invites exactly the false confidence this module exists to prevent.
