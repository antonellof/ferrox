//! Semantic anchor checkpoints: keeping the state an agent is about to
//! come back to.
//!
//! # The workload this exists for
//!
//! An agentic turn is not one generation. The model reasons, calls a
//! tool, the harness runs it, and the *same conversation* comes back
//! with the tool's result spliced in. What comes back is not an
//! extension of what went out -- the harness routinely edits the
//! context at that boundary: it drops the thinking block, rewrites the
//! call into a canonical form, appends a result. So the next request's
//! prompt agrees with the last one up to **the tool call** and diverges
//! after it.
//!
//! That makes the position where the tool call began the single most
//! valuable position in the sequence: it is where the next request will
//! rejoin. Ordinary caching does not know that. A window model slides
//! its window forward as it decodes and, by the time the turn ends, the
//! state around the anchor is long gone -- so the next turn recomputes
//! a prefix that was live thirty tokens earlier.
//!
//! An anchor is one integer that says "this position is worth keeping",
//! and two rules that spend it:
//!
//! - the **window slide** stops short of `anchor - window - retain gap`
//!   instead of following the cursor ([`decode_slide`]);
//! - a **recurrent model** freezes its state at the anchor into its idle
//!   snapshot slot ([`snapshot_at_anchor`]), because recurrent state is
//!   a point rather than a span and cannot be reconstructed from
//!   neighbours.
//!
//! # Why the anchor is dropped rather than held forever
//!
//! Holding a position live costs pool. If decode runs a long way past
//! the anchor, the request is holding two windows -- one at the cursor,
//! one at the anchor -- and the gap between them is unbounded, so the
//! pool floor would have to be unbounded too. [`decode_slide`] drops
//! the anchor once the cursor has drifted more than one window plus the
//! gap past it: at that distance the turn is clearly not about to end,
//! and a prefix that far back is cheaper to recompute than to hold.
//!
//! That bound is exactly what the `anchor_checkpoints` term in
//! [`crate::policy::pool_budget::swa_tokens_per_request`] pays for. Without the drop
//! rule the pool sizing would be a fiction.
//!
//! Ported 1:1 from FreeToken's `scheduler/scheduler.py` (anchor
//! detection), `scheduler/cache.py` (`maybe_free_swa_out_of_window`,
//! `snapshot_toolcall_anchor`) and `utils/hf.py`
//! (`load_toolcall_anchor_id`) (Apache-2.0); see
//! `docs/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
