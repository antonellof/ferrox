//! The transaction around a live cache resize.
//!
//! [`crate::policy::pool_budget::validate_rebuild`] is the *pre-check*: it decides
//! whether a split fits, before anything is freed. That is only half of
//! a resize. The other half is what happens when the arithmetic said
//! yes and the allocation still fails -- which is the case that turns a
//! serving engine into a permanent 503 if it is not handled.
//!
//! # Why a teardown flag rather than a `Result`
//!
//! A resize is destructive in the middle. It frees the old pools, then
//! allocates the new ones, and a failure on either side of that line
//! means something completely different:
//!
//! - **Before** the free: nothing has been given up. The engine is
//!   untouched and still serving, the request is simply rejected, and
//!   the caller may retry immediately.
//! - **After** the free: the old pools are gone. Rejecting the request
//!   is not enough -- the engine has no pools at all, and every
//!   subsequent request would 503 forever. The old sizes must be
//!   allocated back.
//!
//! A plain `Result` cannot tell those apart, because both are `Err`.
//! [`RebuildTxn::teardown_started`] is what distinguishes them, and it
//! is the whole reason this type exists rather than a closure.
//!
//! # Why only a failed ROLLBACK latches
//!
//! A failed rebuild is bad; a failed rollback is unrecoverable. The
//! first leaves an engine serving what it was serving before. The
//! second leaves one with no pools and no way to get them back, and the
//! only honest thing to do is latch
//! [`crate::MaintenanceState::Failed`] and stop pretending requests can
//! be served. Latching on the first would take a serving engine out of
//! service for a resize that changed nothing.
//!
//! # Why the snapshot is only the touched pools
//!
//! The rollback target is the pools the request NAMED, not every pool.
//! Restoring an untouched pool means freeing and re-allocating it, and
//! on the KV side that trips the invalidation gate and wipes a prefix
//! cache that had no reason to be touched -- so a resize of the expert
//! cache would silently cost every cached prefix in the engine.
//!
//! Ported from FreeToken's `scheduler/scheduler.py`; see
//! `docs/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
