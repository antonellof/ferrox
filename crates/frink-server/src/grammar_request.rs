//! Where a request's stated constraint becomes a compiled grammar.
//!
//! Exactly one function answers "what grammar does this request run
//! under", because a request can state the constraint several ways and
//! only one of them may win:
//!
//! | Request field | Today |
//! |---|---|
//! | `"grammar": "<GBNF>"` | compiled and applied (llama.cpp's field, same spelling) |
//! | `response_format: {"type": "json_schema", …}` | the `schema` is compiled to GBNF and applied |
//! | `response_format: {"type": "json_object"}` | not a grammar; the character-class mask in [`crate::json_mode`], decided by the caller of this module |
//! | `response_format` naming any other `type` | 400, naming the type |
//! | both a `grammar` and a `json_schema` | 400: two constraints on one generation, send one |
//!
//! The schema half used to be a 501, because a JSON schema has to become
//! a GBNF grammar before any of this can run and that converter did not
//! exist. It does now --
//! [`frink_models::grammar::json_schema`], a port of llama.cpp's
//! `common/json-schema-to-grammar.cpp` -- so everything after the
//! conversion (masking, accepting, both decode loops, the batcher) is the
//! same path `"grammar"` already took.
//!
//! # What inside `json_schema` is honoured, and what is refused
//!
//! The OpenAI object is `{"name": …, "description": …, "schema": {…},
//! "strict": bool}` and [`JsonSchemaSpec`] is destructured exhaustively,
//! so a field added to that struct cannot be dropped on the floor:
//!
//! | Member | Treatment |
//! |---|---|
//! | `schema` | compiled to GBNF; required, because there is nothing to enforce without it |
//! | `name`, `description` | labels. They constrain nothing, so ignoring them cannot widen or narrow what is accepted |
//! | `strict: true`, or absent | the schema is ENFORCED by the grammar |
//! | `strict: false` | 400, naming the field |
//! | anything else | 400, naming the field (`deny_unknown_fields`) |
//!
//! `strict: false` is a refusal rather than a shrug because OpenAI's two
//! modes are not the same promise: `false` asks for best-effort guidance
//! and permits schemas strict mode rejects, while this server has exactly
//! one behaviour for a schema, which is to enforce it token by token.
//! Serving that under `strict: false` is answering a question the caller
//! did not ask, and doing it silently is how a client learns the wrong
//! thing about what its schema bought it. An OMITTED `strict` is enforced
//! (OpenAI defaults it to `false`, and this table is the notice): a caller
//! who wrote nothing stated no preference, and the stronger guarantee is
//! the only one this engine has.
//!
//! A schema the converter will not compile is a **400 naming the keyword
//! and where it sits**, never a 500 and never a grammar that is only
//! nearly the caller's schema: that would be served with a 200 and read
//! as compliance. The converter is deliberately stricter than llama.cpp
//! here -- upstream discards a keyword no branch tested, so
//! `{"type": "string", "pattern": "^[a-z]+$"}` compiles upstream to a
//! grammar for *any* string.
//!
//! # Property order, stated because it is observable
//!
//! The grammar requires an object's `required` members in a fixed order,
//! the way llama.cpp's does. Upstream that order is the schema's
//! declaration order; here it is LEXICOGRAPHIC, because a
//! `response_format` reaches this module as a `serde_json::Value` and this
//! workspace builds `serde_json` without `preserve_order`, so declaration
//! order is gone before the converter is called. Both are valid grammars
//! for the schema and neither accepts a document the schema rejects. This
//! is the same order [`crate::tool_grammar`] already gives a forced tool
//! call's `arguments`.
//!
//! # Why a refusal is never a silent ignore
//!
//! `logit_bias` was declared on these requests only so it could be
//! refused by name, because serde dropped an undeclared field and the
//! caller got a 200 whose answer was sampled from unbiased logits. A
//! `json_schema` member that is accepted and not applied is the same
//! failure with more expensive consequences: the caller parses the
//! answer.
