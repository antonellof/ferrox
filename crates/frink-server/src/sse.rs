//! The orphan deadline on an SSE stream's send.
//!
//! # What was actually wrong, since the plan got this one wrong
//!
//! The plan (`docs/plans/serving-and-tiered-kv.md`, `sched-output-mailbox`)
//! asked for a single-slot coalescing mailbox to replace "an unbounded
//! channel", on the reasoning that a slow or disconnected SSE consumer
//! would otherwise grow memory without bound. **That premise is false
//! for frink.** The SSE channel is a `tokio::sync::mpsc::channel(64)`
//! -- bounded from the day it was written -- and a send that fails
//! because the receiver is gone already flips the request's cancel
//! token, so a *disconnected* consumer is handled and a *slow* one gets
//! real backpressure. A mailbox would add coalescing (dropping
//! intermediate tokens), which is wrong for a token stream: every chunk
//! is content, not a redundant state update.
//!
//! What backpressure on a blocking thread actually costs is the thing
//! this module fixes. `Sender::blocking_send` parks the calling thread
//! until there is room, and "until there is room" has no upper bound
//! when the receiver is neither draining nor dropped -- a client whose
//! TCP window went to zero, a paused debugger, a phone that walked out
//! of coverage without the socket noticing. The generation runs on
//! `spawn_blocking`, so a parked send pins:
//!
//! - one thread of Tokio's blocking pool, permanently;
//! - an `Arc<Model>`, so `/admin/models/unload` cannot free the weights;
//! - the request's `CancelGuard`, so the id never leaves the registry.
//!
//! Nothing ever unsticks it, because the only two events the send waits
//! for are "the client reads" and "the client disconnects", and a
//! stalled-but-open socket is neither. N such clients retire N blocking
//! threads. That is the orphan case the plan's second bullet named, and
//! it is a liveness bug rather than a memory one.
//!
//! # The fix
//!
//! [`send_or_orphan`] gives the send a deadline. Past it, the stream is
//! declared orphaned and treated *exactly* as a disconnect already is:
//! the same `Err` the caller already handles by cancelling the
//! generation. One stop path, not two -- the discipline `crate::cancel`
//! already keeps.
//!
//! The deadline is deliberately generous ([`DEFAULT_ORPHAN_TIMEOUT`],
//! overridable with `FRINK_SSE_ORPHAN_TIMEOUT_MS`). Hitting it means
//! the client accepted nothing at all while 64 events waited, for that
//! long -- which is not a slow reader, it is a reader that has stopped.
//! A healthy-but-slow client keeps draining and never approaches it.
