//! A bounded ring of finished requests, addressed by an all-time
//! sequence number.
//!
//! A ring that renumbers on eviction leaves a poller two bad options:
//! re-read every row each time, or silently skip whatever fell out
//! between polls. Rows here keep a monotonic sequence number for the
//! life of the process, so [`RequestRing::since`] can say what is new
//! *and* how much was missed -- a client that came back after a burst
//! learns it lost rows instead of quietly under-reporting.
//!
//! The `limit` rule matters as much as the cursor: a truncated page
//! reports the cursor of its last returned row plus one, and only a page
//! that returned everything it matched may report the all-time count.
//! Return the all-time count from a truncated page and the next poll
//! skips exactly the rows the limit cut off.
