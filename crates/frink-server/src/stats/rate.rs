//! Rates, and values nothing has measured yet.

//! [`RateWindow`] divides by the observed span, not by the window. A
//! server running at 50 tok/s, polled one second into a five-second
//! window, has produced 50 tokens; dividing by the window reports
//! 10 tok/s and the number is simply wrong. Dividing by
//! `now - oldest_retained_sample` reports 50, and still decays to zero
//! as the samples age out -- which is the property that matters, because
//! a *cumulative* average would have an idle server reporting the rate
//! it managed an hour ago forever.
//!
//! [`LastKnown`] is the other half of the same honesty rule: a pool that
//! has never reported an occupancy reports nothing, not zero.
