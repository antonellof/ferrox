//! The elastic cache surface: what the pools are, and moving VRAM
//! between them without a restart.
//!
//! `frink-edge` has held the whole policy for a while with nobody to
//! call it. `pool_budget::CacheReadiness` produces the geometry,
//! `pool_budget::validate_rebuild` checks a re-split against the floors and the
//! budget *before* anything is freed, and `maintenance::MaintenanceGate`
//! decides whether a rebuild may start at all. This module is the three
//! HTTP endpoints over them, plus the one piece of real mutation frink
//! can do today: re-budgeting the shared KV block pool.
//!
//! # Why the order of the checks is the design
//!
//! A rebuild is destructive. The whole point of `validate_rebuild` is
//! that every check is arithmetic and happens up front, so a refused
//! rebuild leaves the engine serving exactly what it was serving. That
//! ordering is preserved here and it is the reason the code reads
//! back-to-front from what you might write first:
//!
//! 1. the **gate** (is a rebuild allowed to start?),
//! 2. the **arithmetic** (does the target fit the floors and budget?),
//! 3. only then the **pool** (which can still refuse, and says by how
//!    much).
//!
//! Any refusal at any step reopens the gate and changes nothing.
//!
//! # What frink can actually re-split
//!
//! The KV pool, and only the KV pool. The expert cache is sized once at
//! load from `FRINK_EXPERT_CACHE_BYTES`, and there is no device-side
//! slot pool to move bytes into -- that is `persistent-gpu-expert-cache`
//! in `docs/ROADMAP.md`. A request naming `moe` is therefore refused as
//! a pool this deployment does not have, rather than accepted and
//! silently ignored: an operator who asks for expert slots and gets a
//! `200` has been told the split moved when it did not.
//!
//! Ported from FreeToken's `server/api_server.py` cache routes and
//! `server/accounting.py`; see `docs/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
