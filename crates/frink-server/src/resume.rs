//! Resumable streams: the replay buffer behind `id:` / `retry:` /
//! `Last-Event-ID`, and the polling fallback that reads the same buffer.
//!
//! # Why this is opt-in
//!
//! `docs/plans/frink-ui.md` asks for SSE replay *and* records why it
//! could not simply be added: two-tier cancellation made a dropped
//! socket **stop** the generation, so by the time a client reconnected
//! there was nothing left running to resume into. Emitting an `id:`
//! anyway would have been a promise the server could not keep.
//!
//! That tension is a design call, and the call made here is: **the
//! client decides, per request.** `stream_resumable: true` on
//! `/v1/chat/completions` means "keep going if I disappear, I may come
//! back"; anything else keeps today's behaviour exactly, socket-drop
//! cancellation included. Neither answer is right for both callers -- a
//! browser tab that navigates away wants the CPU back, and a browser
//! tab whose proxy dropped a 90-second generation wants the answer it
//! already paid for -- so the request says which one it is.
//!
//! A resumable request is not left without a stop path: `POST
//! /v1/cancel` still ends it, and that is the tier a page-unload
//! `keepalive` POST can actually reach.
//!
//! # What replay buys, and what bounds it
//!
//! Every event of a resumable stream is stored here as the exact `data:`
//! payload that went out, numbered from zero. A reconnect names the last
//! id it saw and gets everything after it, then continues live. The
//! polling fallback reads the same buffer over plain JSON, which is the
//! answer to the failure this item is named for: a reverse proxy that
//! buffers `text/event-stream` cannot buffer a short JSON response.
//!
//! Two bounds, and both fail closed rather than quietly:
//!
//! - **The window is finite** ([`REPLAY_BYTES`]). Past it the oldest
//!   events are dropped and `first_index` moves up. A reader that asks
//!   for something evicted gets `410 Gone` -- never a stream that
//!   silently skips the middle of an answer, which the client could not
//!   detect.
//! - **Retention is finite** ([`RETAIN_AFTER_FINISH`], [`MAX_SLOTS`]).
//!   A finished stream is kept briefly for a late reconnect and then
//!   dropped, so a long-lived server does not accumulate every answer it
//!   ever produced in memory.
