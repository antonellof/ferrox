//! The executor for [`crate::expert_cache`]'s plans: a bounded slot
//! pool, the copies a plan asks for, and the counter that says a warm
//! step moved nothing.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! [`ExpertCache`](crate::expert_cache::ExpertCache) decides which
//! experts are resident and returns a
//! [`CopyPlan`](crate::expert_cache::CopyPlan) -- and that is where it
//! stops, deliberately: "nothing here moves bytes; the plan is the
//! whole output". Until something executes those plans the whole `q*`
//! split is inert, because a policy that decides how much to fetch
//! decides nothing while no fetch happens. This is the other half: it
//! takes a plan, validates it against a pool it owns the geometry of,
//! performs exactly the copies the plan names, and records what
//! crossed the link.
//!
//! # Still no device memory here
//!
//! The bytes live behind [`SlotDevice`], so this crate keeps holding
//! no tensors and no device allocations, and every rule below stays
//! testable on a host with no GPU at all.
//! [`HostSlotMemory`] is a real implementation of that trait rather
//! than a test mock -- it is the pool a CPU-only build uses, where the
//! "link" is a memcpy.
//!
//! # A plan is applied whole or not at all
//!
//! Every check happens in a pre-pass, before a single byte is written.
//! A plan is a unit: the cache has *already* recorded the residency the
//! plan describes by the time the caller gets it, so a half-applied
//! plan leaves the cache claiming an expert lives in a slot that holds
//! someone else's bytes. That does not fail -- it multiplies, and
//! returns a confident wrong answer. Refusing up front keeps the
//! device exactly as it was, which is a state the cache can be told to
//! resync to.
//!
//! A device fault is the one thing that can still land mid-plan, since
//! only the device knows it failed. Whatever it cost is marked unknown
//! here and named in the error, so the caller can hand the same slots
//! to
//! [`ExpertCache::forget_slot`](crate::expert_cache::ExpertCache::forget_slot)
//! and have the next step re-fetch them instead of reading them. How
//! much is suspect depends on when it failed: a refused copy costs its
//! own slot ([`SlotFault::Device`]), while a failed *flush* costs every
//! slot the plan wrote ([`SlotFault::DeviceFlush`]) -- a backend that
//! batches its transfers cannot say which of them landed.
//!
//! # Row size is checked exactly, not as a minimum
//!
//! A host row shorter than the slot would leave the slot's tail
//! holding the *previous* occupant's bytes: a coherent-looking expert
//! spliced from two, which produces plausible tokens rather than an
//! error. So a length mismatch in either direction is refused.
