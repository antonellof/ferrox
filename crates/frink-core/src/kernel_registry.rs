//! Sealed kernel-lookup registry: makes a *missing* kernel loud instead
//! of silently slow.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! The worst bug class this engine has shipped is not a wrong kernel but
//! an absent one, silently replaced by a correct-but-slow fallback. Two
//! real examples:
//!
//! - IQ4_XS batched prefill ran on the **CPU** because
//!   [`crate::weight_matrix::WeightMatrix`]'s `metal_kind_supported`
//!   predicate and `apply_gpu_batch`'s per-kind dispatch table disagreed
//!   about one kind. The only symptom was a benchmark row 13.7x behind.
//! - Gemma-4-E2B is slower on Metal than on CPU. Output is correct, so
//!   nothing fails; the model simply never reaches a batched path.
//!
//! Both are *lookups that missed*. Neither produced a diagnostic.
//!
//! ## The shape
//!
//! Every dispatch decision that asks "is there a kernel for this
//! (backend, op, quant kind)?" records the answer here.
//!
//! - **Build phase.** While the model is constructed, each weight matrix
//!   is probed eagerly ([`crate::weight_matrix::WeightMatrix::probe_kernels`]):
//!   the same predicates the hot path will consult are evaluated once per
//!   weight and recorded. This is what turns "why is this row slow" into
//!   a startup line.
//! - **[`seal`].** Called once the model is loaded. It summarises the
//!   build picture, warns about quantized weights that will run off the
//!   selected accelerator, and switches on post-seal checking.
//! - **Run phase.** After sealing, a dispatch-site lookup that misses a
//!   *combination the build probe never saw* is by definition an
//!   unpredicted slow path. It warns once, loudly, naming the call site
//!   ([`#[track_caller]`](std::panic::Location)) and the quant kind, and
//!   is a hard error under `FRINK_STRICT_KERNELS=1` so CI and benchmarks
//!   can run closed.
//!
//! ## Cost
//!
//! This sits next to dispatch, so it follows the `OnceLock` discipline
//! used by `metal_dense_enabled` / `min_task_macs`: the environment is
//! read exactly once per process, never per dispatch.
//!
//! On the hot path the added cost is **zero instructions on a hit** —
//! hits are only ever recorded by the build probe, never by a dispatch
//! site. A dispatch site records only when it is *about to take a
//! fallback*, i.e. only when it is already paying orders of magnitude
//! more than the bookkeeping costs.
//!
//! And that bookkeeping never takes an exclusive lock in steady state: a
//! repeat lookup is a shared `RwLock` read plus one relaxed
//! `fetch_add`. The write lock is taken once per distinct call site, to
//! create the row and decide whether to warn. A dispatch path must not
//! be able to serialize rayon workers behind a mutex.
//!
//! `FRINK_KERNEL_REGISTRY=0` reduces every entry point to one relaxed
//! atomic load and a return.
//!
//! ## What it must not do
//!
//! Observe only. Nothing in this module may change a dispatch decision;
//! the predicates it calls are the same ones the dispatch takes, read a
//! second time, and their results are recorded rather than acted on.
