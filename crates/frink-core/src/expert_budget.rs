//! Splitting a memory budget between the GPU expert cache and the KV
//! pool.
//!
//! # Why the expert cache gets first claim
//!
//! Both pools compete for the same bytes, but they do not degrade the
//! same way. A KV pool one page short means one fewer concurrent
//! request or a shorter context -- a scheduling limit, felt as a queue.
//! An expert cache one slot short means every step that routes to the
//! missing expert pays a PCIe transfer or a CPU detour -- a *per-token*
//! tax on every request, forever. So [`plan_cache_budget`] fills the
//! expert cache first, up to full residency, and gives the remainder to
//! KV -- with a floor of `kv_reserve_pages`, because a server that
//! cannot hold a context serves nothing at all.
//!
//! # A byte budget becomes a slot count
//!
//! A user says a number of bytes; a bounded pool of fixed-size slots is
//! the only thing you can actually cap. [`expert_bytes_per_slot`] prices
//! one slot as the sum of its row across every weight bank, and
//! [`plan_cache_budget`] divides. It lives beside
//! [`expert_store`](crate::expert_store), which holds the budget it
//! sizes, and beside [`expert_cache`](crate::expert_cache), whose slots
//! it counts.
//!
//! Ported 1:1 from FreeToken's `engine/cache_budget.py` (Apache-2.0);
//! see `docs/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
