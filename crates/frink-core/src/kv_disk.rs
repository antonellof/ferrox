//! The disk tier for the KV prefix cache: where a block goes so that a
//! prefix survives eviction from RAM, and a process restart.
//!
//! One file per block, named by its
//! [`BlockHash`](crate::kv_block::BlockHash) and sharded into
//! subdirectories by a hex prefix of that hash, so a machine that has
//! cached a million prefixes never puts a million entries in one
//! directory. The payload is the block's per-layer K and V tensors,
//! flattened, in the cache's own dtype -- **no re-encoding, no
//! compression**: a KV block is already dense float data, and a
//! compressor would only spend CPU on the request path to lose.
//!
//! # What a reader is protected from
//!
//! A cache file outlives the process that wrote it, so every failure
//! mode here is "someone else's bytes":
//!
//! - **A torn write.** The publish is temp-file + `fsync` + `rename`,
//!   which is atomic within a directory on every filesystem frink
//!   targets -- a reader sees the whole file or no file. But a crash
//!   mid-`write` to the *temp* file, a truncated copy, or a partial
//!   restore from a backup can still leave a short file lying around,
//!   so the format records its own total length and a SHA-256 of its
//!   body. A file that does not match is refused
//!   ([`BlockFormatError`]), never partially deserialized.
//! - **A different build.** The format is versioned with an explicit
//!   readable-set; an unknown version is refused rather than guessed
//!   at.
//! - **A different model or config.** That is
//!   [`kv_signature`](crate::kv_signature)'s job, and this module does
//!   not duplicate it: a decoded file becomes an
//!   [`UnverifiedBlock`], and only
//!   [`UnverifiedBlock::verify`] against the reader's own expectation
//!   produces a usable [`KvBlock`].
//!
//! # The write-ordering invariant
//!
//! A write is accepted on one thread and finished on another, so for a
//! while a block is "in the store" without being on disk. The rule that
//! makes that safe, and the one every step below is ordered around:
//!
//! > **buffer -> index -> queue.** A concurrent reader must never see
//! > an index hit for a block that has neither a file nor a buffered
//! > payload.
//!
//! So the payload is reachable *before* anything claims the block
//! exists, and on the way out the file is published *before* the
//! buffered copy is released. A reader holds the index lock while it
//! consults the buffer, because "this block is not on disk yet" and
//! "here is its payload" have to be one decision -- as two, the writer
//! can publish and release in between and the reader finds nothing.
//! When that invariant does break, the reader gets
//! [`StoreError::MissingPayload`] rather than a quiet miss: a
//! correctness bug that degrades into a cache miss is a bug nobody ever
//! finds.
//!
//! The queue is bounded and **never drops**: a full queue makes the
//! caller write the block itself ([`DiskStats::inline_writes`] counts
//! it). Dropping writes silently would be indistinguishable from a cold
//! cache later.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! ```text
//! <root>/.tmp/<hash>.<pid>.<n>.tmp     in-progress writes
//! <root>/<hh>/<full-hex>.kvb           published blocks (hh = shard prefix)
//! ```
//!
//! # File format (version 2)
//!
//! ```text
//! magic           8   b"FRXKVBLK"
//! format_version  4   u32 LE, checked against READABLE_FORMAT_VERSIONS
//! header_len      4   u32 LE
//! body_len        8   u64 LE
//! digest         32   SHA-256 over header || body
//! header  header_len  block hash, dims, dtype, block layout, model identity
//! body      body_len  per layer: all K elements, then all V elements
//! ```
//!
//! Version 2 added the two block-layout fields -- block size and
//! sliding window -- and version 1 was dropped from the readable set
//! rather than being read with the window assumed absent. A v1 file
//! cannot say what window it was cut under, and "it did not say" is not
//! "there was none": see [`kv_swa`](crate::kv_swa) for what a
//! mis-aligned block does to an answer. A restart onto this build
//! therefore starts from a cold cache once, and the old files are
//! evicted as unreadable rather than reinterpreted.
//!
//! The digest covers header and body but not the fixed prefix, so the
//! lengths are checked against the real file size *before* anything is
//! hashed or parsed -- a 4 GB `body_len` on a 200-byte file is rejected
//! by arithmetic, not by allocating.
