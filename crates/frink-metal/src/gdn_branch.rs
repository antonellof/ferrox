//! A recurrent layer's whole BRANCH in one command buffer: the two
//! gates, the causal convolution with its SiLU, the per-head l2 norms,
//! the delta rule, the gated output norm, the folded rotation and the
//! output projection.
//!
//! # Why this shape and not another
//!
//! `docs/plans/gdn-resident-state.md` prices a Bonsai decode token: 192
//! command buffers, 71.6 ms of GPU, 29.9 ms of latency beyond it, and
//! about 35 ms of host of which two thirds is the recurrence. The GPU
//! work is already faster than the reference's whole token, the 0.15 ms
//! a submission costs is the OS wake-up, and every way around that has
//! been measured and lost. So the only thing left to remove is host
//! time inside a layer, and this is where nearly all of it is.
//!
//! The projections that FEED this stay where they are. `attn_qkv` and
//! `attn_gate` are one launch already (`WeightMatrix::apply_pair`), and
//! the two gate projections are tiny unquantized matrices whose own
//! measurement said sending them with the pair was neutral. So a
//! recurrent layer keeps the two submissions it has and loses the host
//! step between them, rather than gaining a third.
//!
//! # Why it can win where three earlier attempts lost
//!
//! Those three moved the state once per row through a kernel that read
//! it UNCOALESCED, and measured the kernel against six CPU cores while
//! still paying a submission for it. Two of those three facts have
//! changed: `crate::gdn`'s step reads the state coalesced now, and the
//! submission this rides in already existed. The third has not, and is
//! why the host body stays as the fallback and the caller measures.
