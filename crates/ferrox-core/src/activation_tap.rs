//! A process-wide observer of the f32 activations fed to every
//! [`WeightMatrix`] projection: the seam `ferrox imatrix` collects an
//! importance matrix through.
//!
//! llama.cpp collects its imatrix with a scheduler callback
//! (`cb_eval`) that sees every `MUL_MAT` node and its `src1` input
//! (`tools/imatrix/imatrix.cpp:219-237`). ferrox has no graph, so the
//! equivalent seam is the function every projection goes through:
//! [`WeightMatrix::apply`] for one activation and
//! [`WeightMatrix::apply_batch_with_acts`] for a batch. Both call
//! [`observe`] before they touch the weights.
//!
//! **A `WeightMatrix` carries no name**, and the loader that knows the
//! names lives in `ferrox-models`, so the observer is handed the matrix
//! by reference and it is the installer's job to know which one it is
//! -- `ferrox imatrix` walks the decoder's public weight fields and
//! keys on the address. That is why the callback takes `&WeightMatrix`
//! and not a string: adding a name field would have to be threaded
//! through thirty construction sites across seven loaders to change
//! nothing for inference.
//!
//! Cost when nothing is installed: one relaxed atomic load per
//! projection call, not per element. A decode step is a few dozen
//! calls, so this is not a hot-path concern.
//!
//! The tap sees the f32 input EXACTLY as the projection receives it,
//! before any activation quantization the CPU INT_DOT path does. That
//! is what llama.cpp's callback sees too (`src1->type == F32` is a
//! precondition for collection).
//!
//! What it does NOT see: a GPU batch that fails to launch and degrades
//! to per-row [`WeightMatrix::apply`] would fire the observer twice for
//! the same rows. `ferrox imatrix` pins the CPU backend, where no such
//! degradation path exists, and checks every dense entry's row count
//! against the token count so a double observation is a refusal rather
//! than a silently doubled matrix.
