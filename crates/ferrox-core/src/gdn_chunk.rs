//! The gated delta rule over a CHUNK of tokens, which is the same
//! recurrence as [`crate::gdn::delta_step`] with the state read once
//! per chunk instead of once per row.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! `crate::gdn::tests::delta_step_throughput_probe` measures the
//! sequential step at 36 GB/s of state on an M2 Pro, which is the floor
//! for touching a 3.1 MB state once per row: a 128-token Bonsai prefill
//! moves `128 rows x 48 layers x 6.2 MB = 38 GB` that way, 1.05 s of a
//! 3.9 s `pp128` run, and the profile agrees at 23% of samples. Nothing
//! about the loop is slow; the traffic is the cost, and the only way to
//! cut it is to stop paying it per row.
//!
//! # The algebra
//!
//! Per value head, with `S_t` the state after row `t`, `a_t` the row's
//! decay, `k_t` / `q_t` the key and query, `v_t` the value and `b_t`
//! the gate:
//!
//! ```text
//! d_t   = b_t (v_t - a_t (S_{t-1} k_t))          (a vector over value index j)
//! S_t   = a_t S_{t-1} + d_t k_t^T                 (rank one)
//! out_t = (S_t q_t) / sqrt(S)
//! ```
//!
//! Unrolling the rank-one updates across a chunk gives every quantity
//! in terms of `S_0` and the `d_u` already computed:
//!
//! ```text
//! a_t (S_{t-1} k_t) = A_t (S_0 k_t) + sum_{u<t} R[t][u] (k_u . k_t) d_u
//! out_t             = A_t (S_0 q_t) + sum_{u<=t} R[t][u] (k_u . q_t) d_u
//! S_C               = A_C S_0 + sum_t R[C][t] d_t k_t^T
//! ```
//!
//! where `A_t = a_1 ... a_t` and `R[t][u] = a_{u+1} ... a_t`. Every
//! ratio is a product of decays with no division in it, so a long chunk
//! of small decays underflows to zero (the state's contribution really
//! has vanished) instead of dividing by it, which is what the textbook
//! `d_u / A_u` form does and why that form needs a normalisation step.
//!
//! So a chunk costs three `S x S x C` products (the state against `K`
//! and `Q`, and the state's update) plus a `C x C` forward
//! substitution, which is 1.5x the multiply-adds of the sequential form
//! and `1/C` of its state traffic. The step is bandwidth-bound, so that
//! is the trade worth making.
