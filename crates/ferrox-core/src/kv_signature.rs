//! Compatibility marking for stored KV blocks: whether a block found
//! in a cache may be *used*, as opposed to merely found.
//!
//! A [`BlockHash`](crate::kv_block::BlockHash) says which tokens a block
//! covers. It says nothing about the shape of the tensors stored under
//! it -- how many layers, how many KV heads, what head dimension, what
//! dtype, how many token positions are really there. A cache that
//! survives a restart will eventually be read by a process configured
//! differently from the one that wrote it, and reading a block whose
//! layout does not match is not a miss: it is silently wrong attention
//! state, which produces confident wrong tokens.
//!
//! The one rule this module exists to enforce:
//!
//! > **A signature is derived from the block's own payload, never from
//! > the manager's expectation, and an unmarked block is rejected
//! > rather than trusted.**
//!
//! So [`CacheSignature::from_payload`] measures the tensors; it takes no
//! "expected" shape to fill gaps with. [`UnverifiedBlock::verify`] then
//! makes three separate checks, in order:
//!
//! 1. the block carries a signature at all ([`SignatureError::Unmarked`]
//!    otherwise -- absence is never treated as agreement);
//! 2. the recorded signature matches what the payload actually is
//!    ([`SignatureError::PayloadMismatch`]) -- a stamp may not vouch for
//!    a width the payload does not have;
//! 3. only then, that this shape is the shape the reader wants
//!    ([`SignatureError::Incompatible`]).
//!
//! Step 2 is the one that is easy to skip and expensive to skip: without
//! it, "the stamp says 32 heads" and "there are 32 heads" are different
//! claims that a cache would be treating as one.
//!
//! # The block layout is part of the signature
//!
//! A signature also carries the [`BlockLayout`] the block was cut
//! under: its block size, and the sliding window that block size had to
//! divide (see [`kv_swa`](crate::kv_swa) for why it must). Both are
//! here rather than checked once at startup because a *durable* cache
//! outlives the configuration that filled it. A block written by a
//! build running gpt-oss at window 128 must not be handed to a build
//! running it at window 256, and the failure mode if it were is not a
//! crash -- it is an attention mask silently wider or narrower than the
//! model's.
//!
//! `block_size` is payload-checkable and is checked: a stored block is
//! exactly one whole block (`kv_block::chain` refuses to name a partial
//! tail), so a stamp claiming `block_size = 64` over a 48-token payload
//! is refused the same way a stamp claiming 32 heads over 16 is. The
//! window is not provable from tensors -- like `model` -- so it is
//! carried and compared against the reader's expectation.
