//! The seam every GPU backend goes through.
//!
//! Four things used to exist once per backend as free functions in
//! `weight_matrix.rs`, with no shape holding them together:
//!
//! | Axis | Metal | CUDA |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | kind → matvec | `metal_matvec_kind_name` → `Option<&str>` | `cuda_matvec_kind_supported` → `bool` |
//! | kind → GEMM | `metal_mul_mm_kind_supported` | `cuda_mul_mm_kind_supported` |
//! | launch alias | `MetalMatvecLaunchFn`, 4 args | `CudaMatvecLaunchFn`, 5 args |
//! | enable probe | `metal_dense_enabled` | `cuda_dense_enabled`, byte-identical body |
//!
//! and they were re-selected by hand at every dispatch site, so
//! `apply_gpu` carried two near-identical `match kind` tables that could
//! only be kept honest by a `debug_assert!`. A third backend would have
//! copied all four. This module is the shape they now share.
//!
//! # What a third backend has to provide
//!
//! Exactly this, and nothing else:
//!
//! 1. A unit type (`pub struct Vulkan;`).
//! 2. [`BackendCaps`] — the two capability tables plus an id and a
//!    display name. **Compiled unconditionally**, with no dependency on
//!    the backend crate, because the tables are a property of the kernel
//!    set rather than of the build, and gating them would make them
//!    untestable on the CPU builds that run `cargo test --workspace`.
//!    This is the rule that kept `metal_matvec_kind_name` un-`cfg`'d and
//!    it is load-bearing: `probe_kernels_for` asks what Metal *would*
//!    resolve from a build with no Metal.
//! 3. [`BackendDispatch`] under `#[cfg(feature = "…")]` — the enable
//!    probe, a device-free launch table, and one launch entry point.
//! 4. One line in [`gpu_backend_table`], which is **the** ordered list:
//!    enum variant, cargo feature / registry name, and seam type, once.
//!
//! `Vulkan` is what that recipe looks like when it is followed: a
//! one-kernel backend (Q8_0 matvec, no GEMM, no batch path) added
//! without touching `apply_gpu` or `active_backend`.
//!
//! # The one list, and its three consumers
//!
//! [`gpu_backend_table`] is expanded by exactly three things, so a
//! backend cannot exist in one of them and not the others:
//!
//! - [`crate::kernel_registry::Backend`]'s variants and their names.
//!   This is verdict point 4 — "a backend cannot be dispatched to
//!   without being reportable" — and it is now structural rather than
//!   hand-kept. It works because the registry and this module are the
//!   same crate; a `macro_rules!` cannot generate an enum in a
//!   *different* crate, so a backend crate could never own its own
//!   variant.
//! - [`with_gpu_backends`], the `#[cfg]`-gated dispatch order, which
//!   [`crate::weight_matrix::WeightMatrix::apply_gpu`] and
//!   [`crate::weight_matrix::active_backend`] both expand.
//! - [`with_gpu_backend_caps`], the **ungated** one, which
//!   `probe_kernels_for` expands so a CPU-only build can still ask what
//!   Metal or Vulkan *would* resolve.
//!
//! # The launch signature, and the fifth argument
//!
//! `ferrox-cuda`'s `launch_*_matvec` takes
//! `(weights, x, rows, row_bytes, n_blocks_per_row)`; `ferrox-metal`'s
//! takes the first four. [`BackendDispatch::launch_matvec`] takes the
//! four plus the [`QuantKind`], and every backend derives the rest.
//!
//! That is deliberate, and it is not the wider arity the beachhead
//! verdict proposed. `n_blocks_per_row` is **redundant information**,
//! not missing information: it is `row_bytes / block_bytes(kind)`, and
//! Metal already recomputes exactly that inside
//! `ferrox_metal::gpu::matvec_launch_meta`, which hands back the block
//! size for the kind. Hoisting it into the shared signature would buy a
//! backend nothing it cannot derive, and would cost a
//! `block_bytes(kind)` that is total over all 21 `QuantKind`s — the
//! existing one, `WeightMatrix::block_bytes_for_kind`, is deliberately
//! partial and `unreachable!()`s outside the five CUDA kinds, and
//! Metal's `IQ4_XS` is not one of them. So the seam passes the kind and
//! lets each backend ask its own table.
