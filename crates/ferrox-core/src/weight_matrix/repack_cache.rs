//! A process-wide, byte-budgeted cache of interleaved ("repacked")
//! weight bytes, keyed by the identity of the mapping the bytes came
//! from.
//!
//! A repack rewrites a whole matrix into the row-interleaved layout the
//! `x4` / `x8` GEMV kernels read, so it costs a pass over every weight
//! byte. Done once per matrix that is the load-time cost llama.cpp pays
//! for its `repack` backend. Done once per CALL it is a full copy of the
//! matrix on every token, and that is what shipped: `apply_cpu_q8`, the
//! int-dot matvec the dense FFN gate/up and the MoE experts take, passed
//! a hand-written `/* uncacheable */ None` where every other matvec
//! passed `data.map_id()`. Profiled at one thread on TinyLlama Q8_0,
//! roughly 85% of a decode token was `pack_q8_0_matrix_x4` and the
//! `Arc` copy behind it, against under 10% in the GEMV it fed (#128).
//!
//! The `None` was a second, hand-restated copy of a decision
//! [`WeightBytes::map_id`] already makes: `Owned` and `Shared` bytes
//! answer `None` there, because their address is not an identity, and
//! `Mapped` bytes answer `Some`. Two places deciding one thing, with
//! nothing making them agree, is this repo's dominant bug shape, so the
//! typed lookups below take the [`WeightBytes`] and ask it themselves.
//! A call site can no longer say "uncacheable" on its own authority.
//!
//! # The budget
//!
//! Caching a packing RETAINS a second copy of a matrix that is already
//! mapped. Measured on TinyLlama-1.1B Q8_0, retaining the dense FFN
//! gate/up packings cost **+527 MB of peak footprint** (685 MB to 1213
//! MB), and that scales with gate/up bytes: an 8B checkpoint pays
//! several GB, and a resident MoE pays it once per expert that has ever
//! been routed to. Unbounded, it grows with the number of distinct
//! matrices the process touches, which for an MoE is unbounded in
//! practice.
//!
//! So there is ONE cache, not one per format, holding
//! [`budget_bytes`] at most, evicting least-recently-used entries to
//! stay under it. A matrix that does not fit is packed and returned
//! uncached, so pressure degrades to recomputation and never to a wrong
//! answer -- the same degradation
//! [`crate::expert_store::ExpertStore::acquire`] makes, for the same
//! reason.
//!
//! Five caches would be five budgets over one pool of RAM, which is the
//! defect the budget exists to close, so the format is part of the key
//! instead.
//!
//! The budget itself is DERIVED, in
//! [`crate::host_memory::derived_copy_budget`], from a live probe of the
//! host minus what `expert_store` has already committed. It can be zero,
//! and zero means nothing is ever retained: exactly the behaviour before
//! this cache existed.
