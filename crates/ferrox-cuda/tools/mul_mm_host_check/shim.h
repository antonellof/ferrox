// Enough of the CUDA execution model to run an UNMODIFIED `__global__`
// body on a host CPU: one std::thread per CUDA thread, a counting
// barrier standing in for `__syncthreads()`, and one block at a time so
// that `__shared__` -> function-`static` is a faithful stand-in.
//
// This exists because ferrox's CUDA kernels are written in an
// environment with no NVIDIA GPU. It does NOT emulate a GPU: no warp
// scheduling, no memory model, no coalescing, no races. It checks
// exactly one thing -- that the arithmetic and the index math in the
// emitted CUDA C are the arithmetic and index math the Rust scalar twin
// (`ferrox_cuda::mul_mm_ref`) was tested against.

// kernel reinterpret-casts a `__shared__` row into one of these, and
// this shim maps `__shared__` onto a function-`static` array whose
// alignment nothing guarantees. Over-declaring the alignment would let
// the compiler assume something the host stand-in does not provide,
// which is a different bug from the one this tool is looking for.
//
// Its absence is why this tool checked NOTHING between the `float4`
// inner loop landing and 2026-09-09: every kind failed to COMPILE, the
// `set -e` at the top of run.sh aborted the script, and the run was
// simply never green rather than quietly wrong. A tool that cannot
// compile the thing it checks is worse than no tool.
