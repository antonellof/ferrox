//! The scalar twin of the CUDA `mul_mm` kernel: the same GEMM, executed
//! on the host, one emulated threadblock at a time.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! There is no NVIDIA GPU in the environment this kernel was written in,
//! so the kernel itself cannot be run. This repo's answer to an
//! unrunnable arm is the same one every `unsafe` SIMD path here already
//! gets: a scalar twin implementing identical arithmetic, checked
//! against an independent reference on data the host can compute.
//!
//! [`mul_mm_reference`] is not "a matmul that should give the same
//! answer". It is a **transcription of the kernel**: same tile
//! enumeration, same thread-to-micro-tile mapping, same out-of-range row
//! clamp, same zero-fill of absent tokens, same k-ascending accumulation
//! order, same shared-memory layout. Barriers are modelled by running
//! every thread's load phase before any thread's compute phase, which is
//! exactly what `__syncthreads()` guarantees. Read it beside `BODY_SRC`
//! in [`crate::mul_mm`]; a line that does not correspond to a line there
//! is a bug in one of them.
//!
//! That buys three things a device would otherwise have to: that the
//! index arithmetic addresses the elements it means to, that the
//! per-kind unpack decodes the format, and that partial tiles neither
//! write out of bounds nor drop rows.
//!
//! It does **not**, by itself, establish that the *emitted CUDA C* says
//! the same thing this file says -- the two are hand-transcribed from
//! each other. `tools/mul_mm_host_check/run.sh` closes that gap by
//! compiling the real kernel text and running it against this twin on
//! the host (bit-exact as of 2026-09-01). What remains for hardware:
//! that NVRTC accepts the source, that the barriers survive a real warp
//! scheduler, that the launch config is valid, and what it costs. Those
//! stay unproven until someone runs
//! `cargo test -p ferrox-cuda --features cuda -- --ignored`.
