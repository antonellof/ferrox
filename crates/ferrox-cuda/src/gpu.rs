//! CUDA execution path via `cudarc` 0.11.9 (pinned to this version
//! because newer `cudarc`/`libloading` releases require a rustc newer
//! than the 1.75 available in an earlier development environment for
//! this project -- see Cargo.toml's comment). Uses dynamic loading so
//! this compiles without a CUDA toolkit installed.
//!
//! # Verified on real GPU hardware
//!
//! Five of the six matvec kernels (`launch_q8_0_matvec`,
//! `launch_q4_0_matvec`, `launch_q4_k_matvec`, `launch_q5_k_matvec`,
//! `launch_q6_k_matvec`) have
//! been compiled by NVRTC and executed on real NVIDIA GPUs (RTX 3060s,
//! rented on vast.ai), with their output cross-checked against
//! `ferrox_quant`'s scalar reference for real, non-trivial quantized test
//! data -- not just "the launch didn't error." Run this verification
//! yourself with:
//!   cargo test -p ferrox-cuda --features cuda -- --ignored
//!
//! Real bugs caught and fixed by actually running this on hardware
//! (none were visible from reading the code):
//! - The Q4_0 test's own fixture-generation code built one 18-byte Q4_0
//!   block per row regardless of the test's `cols` value, so for a
//!   64-column test matrix (2 blocks/row) the weight buffer ended up
//!   half the size the test's own indexing expected -- an out-of-bounds
//!   panic in the test harness itself, not the kernel.
//! - Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K failed a fixed absolute tolerance (`1e-2`) against
//!   reference values in the 1e7-1e8 range (small, single-digit-to-tens
//!   diffs) -- root-caused against llama.cpp's real CUDA K-quant kernel
//!   design (integer `dp4a` dot product, converting to float only once
//!   per block, specifically to avoid GPU/CPU float non-associativity)
//!   and its own test convention (`max_nmse_err()`, a relative metric,
//!   never exact equality) -- not a kernel bug. Fixed by switching to a
//!   relative-error assertion (`assert_close_relative`).
//! - That same relative-tolerance assertion then hit a second, narrower
//!   bug on real hardware: `GPU=NaN CPU reference=NaN` for a Q6_K row
//!   whose pseudo-random test bytes happened to decode as a NaN/Inf f16
//!   scale (garbage in, garbage out, identically on both backends) --
//!   `(got - want).abs() <= tol` is always false for NaN under IEEE754,
//!   so two backends that correctly *agreed* (both NaN) still failed the
//!   assertion. Fixed by treating NaN==NaN as agreement explicitly.
//!
//! Q8_0/Q4_0/Q4_K/Q5_K all pass on real hardware as of 2026-07-31; Q6_K's
//! NaN-comparison fix has not yet been re-run on hardware (see that
//! test's own `#[ignore]` message).
//!
//! **`launch_q5_0_matvec` is the sixth, and NO GPU HAS RUN IT.** It
//! landed 2026-09-05 (`docs/plans/cpu-cuda-parity.md` §6) and is a
//! transcription of `ferrox-metal`'s Q5_0 matvec, which is itself
//! `ggml`'s `dequantize_row_q5_0`. Nothing above applies to it: the
//! only checks it has are that the CUDA C names the entry point its
//! table row claims and strides by `Q5_0_BLOCK_BYTES`. Until
//! `cargo test -p ferrox-cuda --features cuda -- --ignored` has run
//! `launch_q5_0_matvec_matches_cpu_reference` on a device and the
//! result is written down, CUDA Q5_0 is a claim, not a capability.
//!
//! The device-probe path (`probe()`) was already verified earlier
//! (tested to degrade correctly with no GPU present -- including a real
//! bug found and fixed in `cudarc`'s panic-instead-of-`Result::Err`
//! behavior when no CUDA library exists at all). A second real bug in
//! that same test surfaced the first time it actually ran *with* a real
//! GPU present (full workspace suite on rented hardware, 2026-07-31):
//! the test hard-coded "no CUDA device here," true on the
//! no-GPU sandbox it was written on but false on real rented hardware --
//! fixed to check both real outcomes instead of assuming one.
//!
//! `WeightMatrix::apply_gpu`-dispatched real MoE generation (a real
//! third-party checkpoint, OLMoE-1B-7B-0924, `FERROX_GPU_VRAM_BUDGET_BYTES`
//! enabled) has been measured end to end: 16.345s for 64 tokens on a
//! rented RTX 3060, correct output, after fixing the per-call CUDA
//! context/recompilation overhead (`shared_device`/`ensure_module_loaded`
//! below) that made the same request take 15+ minutes (never completing)
//! before that fix -- see `docs/MODELS.md` for the full comparison.
//!
//! Not yet verified: a full FFN (multiple fused matvecs) rather than one
//! projection at a time, and behavior on GPUs other than the RTX 3060s
//! this was tested against.
