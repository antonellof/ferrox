//! Run on hardware since 2026-09-15 (RTX 3090, CUDA 12.4): every kind
//! and shape in [`tests::launch_mul_mm_matches_the_scalar_twin`]
//! passes, and `ferrox verify --backend cuda` is token-identical to
//! the CPU on Q4_K_M, Q5_K_M, Q6_K, Q8_0 and IQ4_XS checkpoints. It is
//! written against `cudarc` 0.11.9's API the same way `gpu.rs`'s
//! matvec launchers are, and reuses their plumbing -- the process-wide
//! device (`shared_device`), the load-once NVRTC cache
//! (`ensure_module_loaded_lazy`) and the pointer-keyed resident weight
//! cache (`resident_cuda_weights`) -- rather than growing a second copy
//! of any of it.
//!
//! Two entry points: [`launch_mul_mm`] takes and returns host slices
//! (one upload, one synchronous download), and [`enqueue_mul_mm`] is
//! the launch alone over device slices, which the resident prefill
//! stack ([`crate::prefill`]) chains seven of per layer. The
//! arithmetic both launch is checked on the host by
//! [`crate::mul_mm_ref`]. The hardware test is `#[ignore]`d because it
//! needs a device; run it on real hardware and write down what
//! happened.
