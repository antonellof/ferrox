//! `mul_mm`: a batched quantized GEMM for CUDA -- the CUDA C source and
//! the per-quant-kind dispatch table.
//!
//! # UNRUN ON HARDWARE
//!
//! **No kernel in this module has ever executed on a GPU.** There is no
//! NVIDIA hardware in the environment it was written in, and this repo's
//! standing rule (`docs/plans/roadmap.md`, "CUDA stays at *must
//! compile*") is that a CUDA claim is worth nothing until someone
//! measures it. Nothing here may be described as a measured capability
//! in `docs/FEATURES.md` or `docs/MODELS.md` until
//! `cargo test -p ferrox-cuda --features cuda -- --ignored` has been run
//! on a real device and the result written down.
//!
//! What *is* established, and how:
//!
//! 1. **It is a port, not a design.** The arithmetic comes from
//!    `ferrox-metal`'s `mul_mm_sg_impl` (`crates/ferrox-metal/src/gpu.rs`),
//!    which is at parity with llama.cpp on Metal and has goldens. The
//!    per-kind unpack functions below are line-for-line transcriptions of
//!    that file's `Q8_0Dequant` / `Q4_0Dequant` / `Q5_0Dequant` /
//!    `Q5KDequant` / `Q6KDequant` functors, which are themselves
//!    llama's `dequantize_q8_0` / `dequantize_q4_0` /
//!    `dequantize_q5_0` / `dequantize_q5_K` / `dequantize_q6_K`.
//! 2. **It has a scalar twin.** [`crate::mul_mm_ref`] emulates this
//!    kernel on the CPU -- same tiling, same clamping, same index
//!    arithmetic, same accumulation order -- and its tests, which run in
//!    the default (no-GPU) build, hold it against an independent
//!    dequantize-then-GEMM built on `ferrox_quant`. A transcription
//!    error in the index math or the unpack shows up there.
//! 3. **Geometry cannot drift.** Every tile constant in the emitted CUDA
//!    is `#define`d from the Rust constants in this module, which are
//!    the same constants the twin uses. The kernel and its twin cannot
//!    disagree about a tile size; they can only disagree about the ~10
//!    lines of unpack expression, which is what (1) and (2) cover.
//!
//! 4. **The emitted C itself was executed.**
//!    `tools/mul_mm_host_check/run.sh` compiles each generated `.cu`
//!    against a keyword-and-barrier shim and runs it on the host CPU --
//!    one real thread per CUDA thread, a counting barrier for
//!    `__syncthreads()`, one block at a time so `__shared__` behaves --
//!    then compares it to the twin. Result on 2026-09-01, macOS/clang,
//!    both kinds then in the table, three shapes (exact tiles, partial
//!    on both axes, narrow batch): **zero mismatches, bit for bit**,
//!    including 1,458 positions where a degenerate f16 scale made both
//!    sides NaN together. Deleting one term of the CUDA-only index
//!    arithmetic makes it fail, so it is a check and not a formality.
//!
//!    Re-run on 2026-09-05 over all six kinds: **zero mismatches**
//!    again, 40,932 compared positions. That run was the first for the
//!    K-quants and for Q5_0 -- the tool took `n_cols` from a fixed list
//!    that is not a whole Q4_K super-block, so from the day the
//!    K-quants landed it panicked on the first one and checked
//!    NOTHING. A tool that cannot fire is worse than no tool; `n_cols`
//!    is now rounded up per kind. Sabotaging Q5_0's `qh` shift
//!    (`12` for `16`) makes it report 6,096 mismatches.
//!
//! What none of that covers, and what only hardware can settle: that
//! NVRTC accepts the source (clang and NVRTC are different front ends),
//! that the barrier placement survives a real warp scheduler, that the
//! launch configuration is valid on the target device, and what any of
//! it costs. A real GPU also contracts `acc += a * b` into an FMA, so
//! on-device results will be *close to* rather than equal to the twin's;
//! the hardware test compares with a relative tolerance for that reason.
//!
//! # Why this shape
//!
//! `ferrox-cuda` had no matrix-matrix product of any kind, so a batched
//! prefill decomposed into one matvec per position
//! (`crates/ferrox-core/src/weight_matrix.rs`, the CUDA batch arm). This
//! is the naive tiled `mul_mm` half of
//! `docs/plans/llama-cpp-gap-inventory.md` §2.7; the `dp4a` integer path
//! (llama's `mmq.cu`) is explicitly *not* attempted here.
//!
//! Unlike Metal's version this uses no matrix-fragment intrinsics
//! (`wmma`/`mma`): the K-loop is a plain fp32 FMA over shared-memory
//! tiles. That costs the constant factor and buys a kernel whose
//! arithmetic a CPU twin can reproduce exactly, which is the only kind
//! of correctness available without a device.
