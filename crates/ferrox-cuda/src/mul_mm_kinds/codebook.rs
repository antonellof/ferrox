//! The codebook formats the CUDA `mul_mm` GEMM consumes: IQ4_NL, IQ4_XS
//! and MXFP4. Each is a [`MulMmKind`] row plus the Rust twin of its
//! `dequant_src`, written statement for statement beside it.
//!
//! # What makes these a family
//!
//! Every other kind in the table is *affine*: the stored bits are a
//! magnitude, and dequantizing is `scale * code + bias`. These three
//! store an INDEX. A 4-bit code selects one of sixteen fixed values,
//! and only then is a scale applied. The sixteen values are part of the
//! format -- arbitrary constants no arithmetic re-derives -- so the
//! kernel needs the table resident, which is what
//! [`Codebook`](crate::mul_mm::Codebook) and the `__constant__` array
//! [`kernel_src`](crate::mul_mm::kernel_src) emits from it are for.
//!
//! The `dequant_src` / `dequant_twin` seam itself is unchanged: the
//! contract was always "given the block and `il`, write `SUB` floats in
//! ascending element order", and a table lookup satisfies it exactly as
//! an affine transform does.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Layout and arithmetic from llama.cpp
//! `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/dequantize.cuh:408` (`dequantize_iq4_nl`),
//! `:424` (`dequantize_iq4_xs`) and `:439` (`dequantize_mxfp4`), with
//! the codebooks at `ggml/src/ggml-common.h:1120` (`kvalues_iq4nl`) and
//! `:1126` (`kvalues_fp4`, aliased to `kvalues_mxfp4` at `:1129`).
//!
//! llama's `il`/`ib` decomposition is NOT reused: it splits a
//! super-block across 32 CUDA threads, four elements each, which is a
//! different partition from this GEMM's sixteen-element sub-block. The
//! *element mapping* is the thing taken, and the twins are held against
//! `ferrox_quant`'s whole-block dequants, which are independent
//! implementations of the same formats.
//!
//! # UNVERIFIED ON HARDWARE
//!
//! No kernel here has executed on a GPU. See [`crate::mul_mm`]'s module
//! docs for exactly what the twin and the host check do and do not
//! establish.
