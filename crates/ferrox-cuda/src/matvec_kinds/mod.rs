//! The per-quant-kind matvec table: which formats CUDA can DECODE, and
//! the three strings a launch needs for each.
//!
//! This is the decode counterpart of [`crate::mul_mm::KINDS`], and it
//! is a table for the same reason. The same five rows were once written
//! out three times -- here, inline in `ferrox-core`'s `apply_gpu_multi`
//! and again in `apply_gpu_dense_ffn_swiglu` -- and a kind added to one
//! and not the others silently lost the fused launch while the
//! capability report kept saying GPU.
//!
//! # Always compiled
//!
//! Deliberately outside the `cuda` feature gate, like `mul_mm`. The
//! rows are CUDA C *text* and three `&'static str`s; nothing here needs
//! `cudarc`. That buys two things: `cargo test -p ferrox-cuda` on a
//! GPU-less host still checks that every row names an entry point its
//! source defines and that every embedded codebook agrees with the
//! GEMM's, and `ferrox-core` can ask "does CUDA decode this kind?" on
//! a build with no CUDA feature at all -- which is what lets
//! `Cuda::matvec_kernel` DERIVE from this table instead of restating
//! it. Restating it is how IQ4_XS ended up "supported" with no kernel.
//!
//! The launch itself ([`crate::gpu::matvec_launch_meta`] and the
//! `launch_*_matvec` functions) stays feature-gated.
