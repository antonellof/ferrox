//! Pre-tokenization: which regex a checkpoint's `tokenizer.ggml.pre`
//! selects, and how the text is actually cut with it.
//!
//! Its own module rather than another section of `tokenizer.rs`, which
//! is already past two thousand lines: everything here is a
//! transcription of a foreign source file and is reviewed *against that
//! file*, which is a different job from reviewing the BPE merge loop
//! next door.
//!
//! Two upstream files are the source of truth, and both matter:
//!
//! * `.scratch/llama.cpp/src/llama-vocab.cpp` — the `tokenizer_pre ==
//!   "..."` chain that maps a GGUF string onto a
//!   `LLAMA_VOCAB_PRE_TYPE_*`, and the `switch` that maps that type onto
//!   a regex. The mapping is many-to-one in both directions, so an arm
//!   here is keyed by the *set* of `pre` strings upstream sends to it.
//! * `.scratch/llama.cpp/src/unicode.cpp` — `unicode_regex_split`, which
//!   decides what happens to the text a pattern does NOT match. That
//!   half is [`split_with_gaps`], and getting it wrong loses input bytes
//!   rather than merely splitting them elsewhere.
//!
//! Patterns are transcribed from the strings llama.cpp actually
//! executes, not from the `// original regex from tokenizer.json`
//! comments beside them. The two are meant to be equivalent, but they
//! are not: upstream writes contractions as `'[sS]` where the original
//! writes `(?i:'s)`, and Rust's `(?i)` folds Unicode, so `(?i:'s)` here
//! would also match `'ſ` (U+017F) and `(?i:'k)` would match `'K`
//! (U+212A). Matching the executed form keeps the two engines equal.
