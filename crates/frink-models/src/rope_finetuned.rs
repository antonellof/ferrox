//! `{arch}.rope.scaling.finetuned` as a SWITCH, for the one family that
//! reads it that way.
//!
//! `LLM_KV_ROPE_SCALING_FINETUNED` is a boolean llama.cpp otherwise only
//! prints. Granite is the exception, and says so in a comment:
//!
//! ```text
//! // src/models/granite.cpp:33-35
//! // Granite uses rope_finetuned as a switch for rope, so default to true
//! bool rope_finetuned = true;
//! ml.get_key(LLM_KV_ROPE_SCALING_FINETUNED, rope_finetuned, false);
//! hparams.rope_finetuned = rope_finetuned;
//! ```
//!
//! and the graph then builds no `inp_pos` at all and skips both
//! `ggml_rope_ext` calls when it is false (`granite.cpp:130-133`,
//! `:206-219`; `granite-hybrid.cpp:14-17,178-185` the same). That is
//! the ALiBi class of divergence: a file that declares it would run
//! through a decoder rotating every Q and K head of every layer,
//! fluently, from positions the checkpoint does not encode that way.
//!
//! Until 2026-09-14 frink had no way to express "this architecture,
//! unrotated" and REFUSED the file. It has one since `gpt2` closed:
//! [`crate::rope_layers::RopeLayers::Never`], the rule that rotates
//! nothing, and [`unrotated`] is what selects it. The refusal's fixture
//! (`granite_norope_tiny.gguf`) has a libllama golden now
//! (`tests/granite_family_graphs.rs`).
//!
//! **Which files carry it.** `conversion/granite.py:253`, inside
//! `GraniteHybridModel`, writes it for EVERY Granite-4.0 hybrid export,
//! `false` unless the checkpoint is Bamba or has no Mamba layer at all
//! -- so every real Granite-4.0-H file runs its attention layers
//! WITHOUT RoPE (NoPE), and this switch is what a served `granitehybrid`
//! needs before its logits can match. `GraniteModel` and
//! `GraniteMoeModel` never write the key, so every converter-produced
//! `granite` / `granitemoe` file takes the `true` default and rotates.
