//! When a whole decoder layer can run in ONE Metal submission, and the
//! weights it takes.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! `docs/plans/gdn-resident-state.md` prices a Bonsai decode token: GPU
//! 79 ms, submission latency 35 ms, host about 20 ms. The GPU work is
//! already faster than the reference's whole token and the 0.15 ms a
//! submission costs is the OS wake-up, so the gap is the COUNT: 192 a
//! token, three per layer. `crate::gdn`'s fused branch removed the host
//! step inside a recurrent layer without changing that count, because
//! it rides in a submission that already existed. This is the step that
//! changes the count, and by the same arithmetic it is the last one:
//! one submission a layer is 9.6 ms of latency against today's 35.
//!
//! # What it refuses, and why the list is written out
//!
//! The fused path implements exactly `x + ffn(rms_norm(x + branch))`
//! with a SwiGLU FFN of one dense expert. Everything else a layer can
//! carry -- a routed FFN, a shared expert, an inner norm, projection
//! biases, a post-attention or post-FFN norm, a residual scale, a skip
//! stream, a parallel residual, a down scale, a gpt-oss block, an
//! expert placement plan -- is applied by the host bodies and by no
//! kernel here.
//!
//! So [`LayerFfnParts::for_layer`] DESTRUCTURES `MoeWeights`
//! exhaustively, with no `..`. A field added to that struct does not
//! compile until somebody says whether this path serves it, which is
//! the only thing that reliably stops a fused path from quietly
//! dropping a model feature: this file's own history is eight of them,
//! one at a time.
