//! JSON Schema to GBNF, a port of llama.cpp's
//! `common/json-schema-to-grammar.cpp` (MIT; see
//! `docs/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`).
//!
//! This is what `response_format: {"type": "json_schema"}` needs. The
//! output is GBNF text that [`crate::grammar::parse`] accepts, so it feeds
//! the same pushdown machine as a hand-written grammar -- and every
//! conversion re-parses its own output before returning it, because a
//! grammar that does not parse is a bug in this module and should not
//! reach a caller as a string.
//!
//! # What is ported
//!
//! | Keyword | Behaviour |
//! |---|---|
//! | `type` | `object` `array` `string` `number` `integer` `boolean` `null`, and an array of them as a union |
//! | `properties`, `required` | in declaration order, required first |
//! | `additionalProperties` | `false`/absent closes the object, a schema types the tail, `true` opens it |
//! | `items`, `prefixItems` | a single schema is a list, an array is a fixed tuple |
//! | `minItems`, `maxItems` | beside a single-schema `items` |
//! | `minLength`, `maxLength` | beside an explicit `"type": "string"` |
//! | `enum`, `const` | literal alternatives, JSON-encoded |
//! | `oneOf`, `anyOf` | union of alternatives |
//! | `$ref`, `$defs`, `definitions` | same-document `#/` pointers, recursion included |
//! | `format` | `date`, `time`, `date-time`, `uuid`, `uuid1`..`uuid5` |
//! | `pattern` | an anchored ECMA-262 regex, via [`pattern`] |
//!
//! Annotations (`title`, `description`, `default`, `examples`, `$schema`,
//! `$id`, `$comment`, `deprecated`, `readOnly`, `writeOnly`) are ignored,
//! which is safe: they constrain nothing.
//!
//! # What is refused, by name
//!
//! Everything else, via [`SchemaError::UnsupportedKeyword`]. The rule is
//! in [`branch`]: a keyword the chosen branch did not act on is refused
//! unless the schema's declared `type` makes it vacuous -- `items` beside
//! `"type": "null"` says nothing about a null, so it is dropped, while
//! `pattern` beside `"type": "string"` is refused.
//!
//! The notable refusals are `allOf` (schema intersection), the numeric
//! bounds `minimum` / `maximum` / `exclusiveMinimum` / `exclusiveMaximum`
//! (llama.cpp builds a digit-by-digit range grammar for integers), `not` /
//! `if` / `then` / `else`, `patternProperties`, `propertyNames`,
//! `uniqueItems`, `minProperties` / `maxProperties`, `multipleOf`, the
//! `dependent*` family, and any `format` outside the six above.
//!
//! **This is stricter than llama.cpp on purpose.** Upstream's `visit` is a
//! chain of `if`s: a keyword no branch tested falls off the end and is
//! discarded, so `{"type": "string", "pattern": "^[a-z]+$"}` compiles to a
//! grammar for *any* string. That grammar accepts documents the caller
//! declared invalid, which is a wrong answer, not a missing feature. Per
//! `CLAUDE.md`, a refusal is coverage.
//!
//! # Where this differs from llama.cpp on schemas it accepts
//!
//! - `_not_strings` writes property-name bytes into a GBNF character class
//!   unescaped, so upstream emits an unparseable grammar for a property
//!   named `a-b`, `a]b` or `añb`. This port escapes the class and keys the
//!   trie on `char` rather than `u8`.
//! - JSON Pointer escapes (`~1`, `~0`) in a `$ref` are decoded. Upstream
//!   splits on `/` and cannot address such a member at all.
//! - Remote (`https://`) `$ref`s are refused rather than fetched.
//! - `pattern` compiles the subset of ECMA-262 that upstream compiles, but
//!   refuses several inputs upstream mishandles rather than reproducing the
//!   mishandling: a lookaround group (upstream warns, then silently drops
//!   the group), an escape its own GBNF parser rejects (`\s`, `\b`, a
//!   backreference, a dangling `\`), a stray `]` or `}` (upstream loops
//!   forever), `*` with nothing before it (upstream reads past the end of a
//!   vector), and a top-level `)` (upstream returns early, discarding the
//!   rest of the pattern). `\d` / `\D` / `\w` / `\W` are translated to
//!   their exact ECMA-262 classes, where upstream copies them through into
//!   a grammar that does not parse. See [`pattern`].
//! - A top-level schema whose rule ends up named something other than
//!   `root` is refused ([`SchemaError::RootDisplaced`]) instead of silently
//!   producing a grammar that starts from a subschema; upstream reaches
//!   this whenever a property is named `""`.
//!
//! # Property order
//!
//! The order of `properties` is part of the accepted language: required
//! members are emitted in declaration order. [`json_schema_to_grammar`]
//! parses the schema text with [`value::JsonValue`], which keeps document
//! order the way llama.cpp's `nlohmann::ordered_json` does.
//! [`json_schema_to_grammar_value`] can only carry the order its
//! `serde_json::Value` already has, and this workspace builds `serde_json`
//! without `preserve_order`, so that entry point orders properties
//! lexicographically. Prefer the text entry point when the caller has the
//! raw JSON.
