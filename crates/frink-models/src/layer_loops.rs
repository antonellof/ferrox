//! **THE SAME PHYSICAL LAYERS RUN MORE THAN ONCE** -- Nanbeige's
//! `num_loops`, as one value a `ModelConfig` carries and one rule for
//! which logical layer runs which weights and where the loop norm sits.
//!
//! # What it is
//!
//! `src/models/nanbeige.cpp:6-12` read `{arch}.num_loops` (default 1)
//! and `{arch}.skip_loop_final_norm` (default false). With `n_loops >
//! 1`, `:19-31` set `n_layer_all = n_layer_phys * n_loops` and COPY the
//! per-layer head / kv-head / ff / swa arrays from physical layer `i`
//! to every logical slot `i + j * n_phys`; `:47-66` create tensors for
//! the `n_phys` physical layers only and `:69-73` alias
//! `layers[i + j * n_phys] = layers[i]`. So the graph (`:94-176`) walks
//! `n_layer_all` logical layers, each with its OWN KV cache and its own
//! row in every per-layer table, over `n_phys` sets of weights. After
//! the last logical layer of every pass but the final one (`:167-175`:
//! `(il + 1) % n_phys == 0 && (il + 1) < n_layer`), the running
//! residual is normed with `output_norm` -- the lm_head's norm, the
//! same tensor -- unless `skip_loop_final_norm`. Everything inside a
//! pass is plain Llama.
//!
//! # Reach -- MEASURED
//!
//! `grep -l 'n_loops\|n_layer_phys' src/models/*.cpp` over all 155
//! graphs (2026-09-12) is `nanbeige.cpp`; `LLM_KV_NUM_LOOPS` and
//! `LLM_KV_SKIP_LOOP_FINAL_NORM` are read nowhere else. So
//! [`LOOP_READERS`] has one row and the keys are dead metadata on every
//! other architecture, as upstream (the `yarn_log_multiplier` rule,
//! `crate::yarn_magnitude`).
//!
//! # What frink does with it
//!
//! The weights are shared and the KV is not, and the seam says exactly
//! that rather than copying weights: `Decoder::layers` stays the
//! PHYSICAL vector the loader filled, `ModelConfig::n_layers` is the
//! LOGICAL count (so every KV cache, per-layer table and budget is
//! sized per logical layer, as `n_layer_all` sizes them upstream), and
//! `Decoder::layer_for(l)` is the ONE mapping from a logical index to
//! its weights, `l % n_phys`. The three host bodies iterate logical
//! indices and ask it; `LayerLoops::loop_norm_after(l)` says where the
//! loop norm goes and `Decoder::final_norm` is the tensor that goes
//! there. The per-layer shape arrays are replicated at load, as
//! `:24-26` replicate them.
//!
//! Every fused Metal launch indexes `layers[l]` and `metal_kvs[l]` with
//! one `l`, so `metal_can_serve_model` refuses a looped model; the host
//! bodies serve it. A LoRA adapter attaches to physical layers by
//! tensor name and so reaches every logical layer that shares them,
//! which is what `build_lora_mm` on an aliased `layers[il]` does too.
