//! WHERE the routing weight multiplies a routed expert: its output, or
//! its input.
//!
//! `llama-graph.cpp:1947`:
//!
//! ```text
//! const bool weight_before_ffn = arch == LLM_ARCH_LLAMA4; // for llama4, we apply the sigmoid-ed weights before the FFN
//! ```
//!
//! and `:2086-2090` multiply the (repeated) input by the selected
//! weights before `build_lora_mm_id`, where `:2246-2249` multiply the
//! expert OUTPUT for everyone else. So Llama 4 computes
//! `down(silu(gate(w x)) * up(w x))` where every other graph computes
//! `w * down(silu(gate(x)) * up(x))`, and since SwiGLU is not
//! homogeneous the two differ on every token (the fixture's logits
//! move by 0.86 between them, measured). Reach: `grep -n LLM_ARCH_LLAMA4
//! src/llama-graph.cpp` is this line and `:1999`, which selects the
//! top-k on the raw logits instead of the sigmoid probabilities -- a
//! monotone map, so the same experts -- and nothing else. One graph of
//! 140, so the fact is a `bool` on `MoeLayerConfig`.
//!
//! It is served by scaling the INPUT ROW per slot and carrying a
//! weight of 1 through the output sum, at the two host sites that
//! gather a routed expert's input (`Decoder::cpu_moe_serial_experts`
//! for the row body, `Decoder::moe_ffn_batch` for the batched one);
//! the shared-activation kernel `cpu_moe_topk_parallel_slots` quantises
//! ONE input for every slot and declines the model, and every fused
//! Metal MoE launch is behind `Decoder::metal_can_serve_model`, which
//! refuses Llama 4 on its chunked window.
