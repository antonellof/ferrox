//! The one outbound HTTP client in `frink-server`, used only by
//! `/admin/download`.
//!
//! ## Why a client dependency at all
//!
//! The workspace had no HTTP *client* before this: `axum`/`hyper` are
//! the server side, and `frink_models::hf_pull` shells out to the
//! `huggingface_hub` CLI, which is not installed on most machines, is
//! not resumable under our control, and reports progress only to its
//! own terminal. A download the UI can show a real progress bar for
//! needs the byte counter in-process, so `ureq` (blocking, rustls) is
//! added -- deliberately with `default-features = false` so it brings
//! rustls and webpki-roots, most of which the TLS-serving side already
//! pulled in, and not a second async runtime.
//!
//! Blocking on purpose: every call here runs on `spawn_blocking`
//! alongside the file writes it feeds, so the Tokio reactor is never
//! parked on a socket read.
//!
//! ## Redirects and resume
//!
//! `…/resolve/main/<file>` redirects to a CDN host. Whether a `Range`
//! header survives that hop is not something this code assumes: it asks
//! for a range and then believes the *status*. Only a `206` counts as a
//! resume; a `200` means the server is sending the whole file from byte
//! zero, and the caller truncates rather than appending a second copy of
//! the prefix onto the first.
