//! Which tensor each of a decoder layer's norm sites is stored under,
//! and with which function, per architecture -- resolved ONCE.
//!
//! A generic layer has up to four norm sites, plus the final one before
//! the lm_head:
//!
//! ```text
//! ffn_inp = x       + post_attn( attn( pre_attn(x) ) )
//! out     = ffn_inp + post_ffn ( ffn ( pre_ffn(ffn_inp) ) )
//! logits  = lm_head( output( out ) )
//! ```
//!
//! llama.cpp names each site's tensor per architecture, in that
//! architecture's `load_arch_tensors`, and reuses ONE tensor name for
//! DIFFERENT sites: `blk.N.attn_output_norm` (`LLM_TENSOR_ATTN_OUT_NORM`,
//! `llama-arch.cpp:423`) is `dbrx`'s pre-FFN norm (`dbrx.cpp:34,110-113`)
//! and `grok`'s post-attention norm (`grok.cpp:62,143-146`), and
//! `blk.N.post_attention_norm` (`LLM_TENSOR_ATTN_POST_NORM`) is Gemma-2's
//! post-attention norm and `gpt-oss`'s pre-FFN one. So which SITE a
//! tensor feeds is decided by the architecture string, never by which
//! tensors happen to be present: reading one file's tensor with
//! another's meaning moves a whole norm to the other side of a residual
//! add, silently.
//!
//! **Why one table.** `loader.rs` used to decide all of this with a
//! chain of `if` branches restated at the pre-attention, pre-FFN and
//! final sites -- three copies of one decision, and each new
//! architecture added a branch to each. Two of those branches also
//! answered "which FUNCTION" (RMS, LayerNorm, none) alongside "which
//! TENSOR", so the norm function was decided three times too. Here the
//! function is [`NormFunction`], read once, and each site is a
//! [`StoredNorm`] naming the tensor spellings it accepts and whether the
//! file must have one. The loader reads the table; it does not restate
//! it.
//!
//! The lists below are the whole content of the table, and each one
//! cites the graph it was read from. `loader.rs`'s
//! `the_norm_slot_and_function_lists_cannot_contradict` pins that no
//! architecture is on two lists that would read one tensor two ways,
//! and `every_architecture_keyed_behaviour_table_names_a_real_generic_row`
//! that every name is a row this loader can reach.
