//! An attention layer's attention ON THE DEVICE, against the
//! sequence's own KV mirror.
//!
//! # Why this is the last one
//!
//! With the projections riding in the previous recurrent run and the
//! tail in the next, the only thing an attention layer still returned
//! to the host for was the attention itself, because the KV lived
//! there. That cost two things: a submission boundary, and a term that
//! GROWS with the context. Measured on one box, the reference is flat
//! from 32 to 300 tokens (11.46 to 11.50) and this engine was not
//! (11.1 to 10.95), and that difference is precisely a host attention
//! whose work is linear in `seq_len`.
//!
//! # The mirror, and why it cannot go stale
//!
//! `KvCache::metal_attn` is the sequence's own device copy, appended
//! one row a token. The host `k`/`v` stay complete and authoritative,
//! so nothing else in the engine changes: truncation, the prefix cache,
//! slot files and every host reader work as before.
//!
//! The mirror is trusted only while its `seq_len` is exactly the
//! cache's `rows()`. Anything that moves a cache backwards leaves the
//! two disagreeing, and the next use re-uploads the whole history
//! instead of guessing which rows are still good. That is one upload
//! in exchange for not having to enumerate every path that can rewind
//! a cache -- and the enumeration is what would rot.
