//! Whether a windowed layer's host KV cache may drop rows behind its
//! window, and which window it drops behind.
//!
//! [`frink_core::kv_swa::KvWindow`] is the arithmetic -- how many rows
//! survive N positions. This module is the *decision*: which layers get
//! one at all, and whether this particular run is one where dropping a
//! row is safe. Those are different questions with different owners, and
//! keeping them apart is what stops the budget from pricing a saving the
//! store did not take (#33) or the store from taking one the budget did
//! not price.
//!
//! # Off by default
//!
//! `FRINK_KV_WINDOW=1` turns it on, and nothing else does. The switch
//! exists in the shape `FRINK_CPU_POOL` established: one env var, so
//! the before and the after are one word apart and reverting costs
//! nothing.
//!
//! # What the switch refuses to do
//!
//! Eviction is the contiguous host store on the CPU path, and only that
//! (#61 steps 3 and 4 are the GPU stores and the paged one). Two things
//! it therefore turns itself off for:
//!
//! - **Metal attention.** `Decoder`'s Metal arms compare
//!   `MetalKvBuffers::seq_len` against the host cache's `rows()` and its
//!   `positions()` in five places, and take the two as interchangeable.
//!   They are, until a host cache evicts. So a run with
//!   `FRINK_METAL_ATTN` on does not evict, and says so here rather than
//!   in five separate conditions that would drift apart.
//! - **Full-attention layers**, obviously, and that is the interesting
//!   half of the saving rather than a caveat: an alternating-SWA model
//!   keeps every position in its dense layers no matter what this
//!   switch says. The Gemma-3 figure in #61 is a per-layer number, not
//!   a whole-model one.
//!
//! CUDA needs no exclusion: the resident-KV decode hook in
//! `Decoder::gqa_attention` is reachable only from the `window == None`
//! arm of `push_and_attend_row`, so it never sees a cache that evicts.
