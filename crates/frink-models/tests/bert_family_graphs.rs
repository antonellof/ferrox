//! The BERT-family encoders against llama.cpp's own pooled embedding,
//! on synthetic fixtures: `nomic-bert` and `jina-bert-v3`.
//!
//! # What these rows are
//!
//! `src/models/bert.cpp`'s graph serves several architectures, and the
//! ones frink builds differ from `bert` in two lines of it and
//! nothing else. `bert_gguf_loader::ENCODER_ARCHS` is the table:
//!
//! | arch | rotation | FFN |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `bert` | learned position table | ungated GELU, both biases |
//! | `nomic-bert` | NEOX RoPE on Q/K | gated SiLU, no biases |
//! | `jina-bert-v3` | NEOX RoPE on Q/K | ungated GELU, both biases |
//!
//! `nomic-bert` differs from `bert` in exactly two lines:
//!
//!   * **RoPE on Q and K** (`:126-133`, NEOX by
//!     `llama_model_rope_type`), where `bert` adds a learned position
//!     table to the embeddings instead (`:90`, gated on
//!     `arch == LLM_ARCH_BERT`). A rotating file carries NO
//!     `position_embd`: measured, libllama's load log never names it
//!     for this architecture, and `bert_gguf_loader` refuses a
//!     rotating file that carries one rather than ignoring it.
//!   * **A gated SiLU FFN** (`:195-201`, the final `else`): `ffn_up`
//!     and `ffn_gate` with no biases, where `bert`'s is an ungated
//!     GELU with both.
//!
//! `bert_encoder::BertFfn` and `BertHparams::rope_theta` are those two
//! facts, read from the architecture at load through
//! `bert_gguf_loader::ENCODER_ARCHS` -- not from tensor presence,
//! because a `bert` file that happens to carry a gate would then run
//! gated here and ungated in llama.cpp.
//!
//! # Why a synthetic fixture and a committed golden
//!
//! `tests/bert_llama_cpp_parity.rs` is the same comparison against a
//! real 36 MB checkpoint and is `#[ignore]`d for that reason. This one
//! runs everywhere: the fixture is 200 KB of F32 in the repo and the
//! golden is what `tools/llama_logits.c --embed` printed for it,
//! through llama.cpp's own MEAN pooling.
//!
