# Builds the `frink parity` reference dumper against an installed
# libllama. The dumper is C, not Rust, and is not part of the cargo
# workspace on purpose: it exists to be llama.cpp's own answer, so it
# links llama.cpp's own library rather than reimplementing anything.
#
# Override the llama.cpp prefix with LLAMA_CPP_PREFIX when it is not a
# Homebrew install (a source build works too — point at the directory
# holding include/llama.h and lib/libllama.*, OR a cmake build dir whose
# libllama lives under bin/ with headers in LLAMA_CPP_SOURCE).
#
# BUILD IT TWICE. `frink parity` takes `--dumper` more than once, and
# the second one is not a nicety: with a single reference it cannot
# render a WRONG verdict on any K-quant checkpoint at all, because two
# builds of llama.cpp have been measured 3.5e-2 apart in KL from an
# identical graph and no constant can sit above that and still mean
# anything (issue #111). Two dumpers give the run a line it measured
# for itself. LLAMA_LOGITS_OUT names the binary so the second build does
# not overwrite the first:
#
#   bash tools/build_llama_logits.sh                      # target/llama_logits
#   LLAMA_CPP_PREFIX=/tmp/llamabuild \
#     LLAMA_LOGITS_OUT=target/llama_logits_scratch \
#     bash tools/build_llama_logits.sh
#
#   frink parity -m model.gguf \
#     --dumper target/llama_logits --dumper target/llama_logits_scratch

# THE REFERENCE'S VINTAGE IS PART OF THE RESULT.
#
# Homebrew's `llama.cpp` bottle can be months behind `.scratch/llama.cpp`,
# and a stale reference does not fail loudly -- it disagrees, and the
# disagreement reads as a frink bug. Both known cases were the bottle:
#
#   * bottle 7650 predates `BertNormalizer`'s `strip_accents` switch, so
#     it welds a standalone combining acute into the word and yields
#     `[UNK]` where current llama.cpp, HuggingFace and frink all drop
#     it. That showed up as a WordPiece "divergence" that was not one.
#   * the same bottle cannot LOAD a gemma-4 checkpoint at all, so
#     `frink parity` skipped that model entirely and its tokenizer went
#     unchecked.
#   * Qwen2.5-1.5B Q4_K_M parity used to be reference-dependent: DRIFT
#     against Homebrew (KL ~7.7e-3) but WRONG against a fresh scratch
#     build (KL ~2.7e-2, same top-1). The verdict no longer moves with
#     the bottle -- `parity` measures the two builds against EACH OTHER
#     and judges frink against that, which is why you want both
#     dumpers. But every printed KL still belongs to the reference the
#     report names, so a NUMBER quoted without its libllama is still
#     half an experiment.
#
# Building llama.cpp from `.scratch/llama.cpp` and pointing this script
# at it fixed both: BGE went DIVERGES to MATCH, and gemma-4 joined the
# sweep. If a single model disagrees and the rest match, SUSPECT THE
# REFERENCE before the engine:
#
#   cmake -B /tmp/llamabuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLAMA_CURL=OFF \
#     -DLLAMA_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DLLAMA_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DLLAMA_BUILD_TOOLS=OFF \
