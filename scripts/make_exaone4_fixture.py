"""Generate the tiny synthetic `exaone4` GGUF used by ferrox's EXAONE-4
coverage test.

`exaone4` is LG AI Research's EXAONE 4.0, and it is NOT the audited
`exaone` row (EXAONE 3.x, `src/models/exaone.cpp`, a plain pre-norm
llama). It refused as UNAUDITED, triaged NEW CODE, for the same blocker
as `olmo2`: `src/models/exaone4.cpp:60-67` is the complete per-layer norm
list and it creates `attn_post_norm`, `attn_q_norm`, `attn_k_norm` and
`ffn_post_norm` and **no `attn_norm` and no `ffn_norm`**. The graph reads
the raw residual at both sublayers -- `cur = inpL` before `build_qkv`
(:118, :124) and `build_ffn(ffn_inp, ...)` on the un-normed
post-attention residual (:159) -- and applies its two norms to each
branch's OUTPUT before the residual add (:152-155, :166-169).

    ffn_inp = x       + attn_post_norm(attn(x))
    out     = ffn_inp + ffn_post_norm(ffn(ffn_inp))

Identical to `olmo2.cpp:92,160-165,169,177-182`. The two rows share ONE
implementation in ferrox (`crates/ferrox-models/src/norm.rs`), and
this fixture and `olmo2_tiny.gguf` are what prove they are the same
graph rather than two that look alike.

What differs from `olmo2`, and why this row needs its own fixture:

  * **PER-HEAD QK-norm.** :61-62 sizes `attn_q_norm` and `attn_k_norm`
    `{n_embd_head_k}`, and :127-128 applies them to what `build_qkv` has
    ALREADY reshaped to 3-D (llama-graph.cpp:1656-1658), so the RMS is
    taken per head. `olmo2` norms the 2-D projection over its whole
    width. Same topology, opposite QK-norm style -- and ferrox picks
    between the two off the weight LENGTH, so this fixture is what
    checks the length it derives from a real per-head file.
  * Applied BEFORE RoPE (:127-128 precede :132-138).
  * `1.0f / sqrtf(float(n_embd_head))` at :145, so
    `ModelConfig::attention_scale` stays `None`.
  * `LLM_FFN_SILU, LLM_FFN_PAR` (:163): plain SwiGLU with `ffn_gate`.
  * NEOX RoPE (`LLM_ARCH_EXAONE4` is in `llama_model_rope_type`'s NEOX
    group, llama-model.cpp).

**THE LAYER COUNT IS THE ARGUMENT**, because llama.cpp switches the
whole SWA machinery on off it with no GGUF key involved: `:4-14` is
`if (hparams.n_layer() == 64)` around `swa_type =
LLAMA_SWA_TYPE_STANDARD`, `n_swa`, `set_swa_pattern(4)` and both SWA
RoPE fields, and `:116` then makes RoPE conditional --
`use_rope = hparams.is_swa(il) || swa_type == NONE`. So a 64-layer
EXAONE-4 (the 32B) gives its FULL-ATTENTION layers **no rotation at
all**, and a 30-layer one (the 1.2B) rotates everything and ignores any
window its file declares.

That is TWO GRAPHS behind one architecture string, so this script emits
both from ONE body rather than growing a copy per size: `--layers 30`
is the 1.2B and `--layers 64` the 32B, and the 32B also gets
`{arch}.attention.sliding_window` -- which the 30-layer file
deliberately does NOT carry, so the pair separates "llama.cpp ignores
the key below 64 layers" from "the key was absent". The 32B's window is
deliberately NARROWER than the six-token prompt, so the mask is
exercised too rather than being a no-op at this size.

The rule itself is `ferrox-models/src/rope_layers.rs`, shared with
`exaone-moe`, `smollm3`, `smallthinker`, `afmoe` and `llama4`.

Weights are pseudo-random from a fixed seed so the file is byte-stable.

Usage:
    PYTHONPATH=/path/to/llama.cpp/gguf-py \\
        python3 scripts/make_exaone4_fixture.py OUT.gguf [--layers 30|64]

The golden values that go with it are produced by llama.cpp itself
(see `scripts/gptoss_reference_logits.cpp`), not by this script.
